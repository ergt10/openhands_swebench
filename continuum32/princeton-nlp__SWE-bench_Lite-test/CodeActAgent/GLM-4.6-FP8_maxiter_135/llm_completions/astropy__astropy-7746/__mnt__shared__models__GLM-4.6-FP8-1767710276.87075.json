You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* If working in a git repo, before you commit code create a .gitignore file if one doesn't exist. And if there are existing files that should not be included then update the .gitignore file as appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT>\n# \ud83d\udd10 Security Risk Policy\nWhen using tools that support the security_risk parameter, assess the safety risk of your actions:\n\n\n- **LOW**: Read-only actions inside sandbox.\n  - Inspecting container files, calculations, viewing docs.\n- **MEDIUM**: Container-scoped edits and installs.\n  - Modify workspace files, install packages system-wide inside container, run user code.\n- **HIGH**: Data exfiltration or privilege breaks.\n  - Sending secrets/local data out, connecting to host filesystem, privileged container ops, running unverified binaries with network access.\n\n\n\n**Global Rules**\n- Always escalate to **HIGH** if sensitive data leaves the environment.\n</SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>\n* IMPORTANT: If you were using the task_tracker tool before a condensation event, continue using it after condensation\n* Check condensation summaries for TASK_TRACKING sections to maintain continuity\n* If you see a condensation event with TASK_TRACKING, immediately use task_tracker to view and continue managing them\n</TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n* Shell options: Do NOT use `set -e`, `set -eu`, or `set -euo pipefail` in shell scripts or commands in this environment. The runtime may not support them and can cause unusable shell sessions. If you want to run multi-line bash commands, write the commands to a file and then run it, instead.\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n  (3) timeout (number, optional): Optional. Sets a hard timeout in seconds for the command execution. If not provided, the command will use the default soft timeout behavior.\n  (4) security_risk (string, required): The LLM's assessment of the safety risk of this action. See the SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT section in the system prompt for risk level definitions.\nAllowed values: [`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`]\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: think ----\nDescription: Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed.\n\nCommon use cases:\n1. When exploring a repository and discovering the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective.\n2. After receiving test results, use this tool to brainstorm ways to fix failing tests.\n3. When planning a complex refactoring, use this tool to outline different approaches and their tradeoffs.\n4. When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.\n5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts and hypotheses.\n\nThe tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does not execute any code or make changes.\nParameters:\n  (1) thought (string, required): The thought to log.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: finish ----\nDescription: Signals the completion of the current task or conversation.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- You have successfully completed the user's requested task\n- You cannot proceed further due to technical limitations or missing information\n\nThe message should include:\n- A clear summary of actions taken and their results\n- Any next steps for the user\n- Explanation if you're unable to complete the task\n- Any follow-up questions if more information is needed\n\nParameters:\n  (1) message (string, required): Final message to send to the user\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #4: task_tracker ----\nDescription: This tool provides structured task management capabilities for development workflows.\nIt enables systematic tracking of work items, progress monitoring, and efficient\norganization of complex development activities.\n\nThe tool maintains visibility into project status and helps communicate\nprogress effectively to users.\n\n## Application Guidelines\n\nUtilize this tool in the following situations:\n\n1. Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress. Always `view` the current list before making changes.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `plan`]\n  (2) task_list (array, optional): The full task list. Required parameter of `plan` command.\n---- END FUNCTION #4 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #5: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a text file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The following binary file extensions can be viewed in Markdown format: [\".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"]. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n* This tool can be used for creating and editing files in plain-text format.\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n  (8) security_risk (string, required): The LLM's assessment of the safety risk of this action. See the SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT section in the system prompt for risk level definitions.\nAllowed values: [`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`]\n---- END FUNCTION #5 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.\n\n--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------\n\nUSER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.\n\n\nASSISTANT: Sure!

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3 directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit d5bd3f68bb6d5ce3a61bdce9883ee750d1afade5.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------\n\nPLEASE follow the format strictly!

The error occurs because the underlying WCS library (wcslib) expects coordinate dimensions to match the WCS parameters, but empty arrays don't provide the expected structure.\n\n**1.4 Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Import WCS from astropy.wcs\n2. Create a WCS object from a FITS file (e.g., '2MASS_h.fits')\n3. Call `wcs.wcs_pix2world([], [], 0)` with empty lists\n4. Observe the `InconsistentAxisTypesError`\n\n**1.5 Best Practices:**\n- Handle edge cases gracefully (empty inputs)\n- Maintain API consistency - empty inputs should return empty outputs\n- Minimal changes to avoid breaking existing functionality\n- Test with various input types (lists, arrays, different dimensions)\n\nLet me now explore the WCS module:\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs</parameter>\n<parameter=security_risk>LOW</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nHere's the files and directories up to 2 levels deep in /workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs, excluding hidden items:\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__init__.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__pycache__/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-36.pyc\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__pycache__/_docutil.cpython-36.pyc\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__pycache__/docstrings.cpython-36.pyc\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__pycache__/setup_package.cpython-36.pyc\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__pycache__/wcs.cpython-36.pyc\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/_docutil.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/_wcs.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/docstrings.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/include/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/include/astropy_wcs/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/include/astropy_wcs_api.h\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/include/wcsconfig.h\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/include/wcslib/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/setup_package.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/astropy_wcs.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/astropy_wcs_api.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/distortion.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/distortion_wrap.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/docstrings.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/pipeline.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/pyutil.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/sip.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/sip_wrap.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/str_list_proxy.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/unit_list_proxy.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/util.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/wcslib_tabprm_wrap.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/wcslib_wrap.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/__init__.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/data/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/extension/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/maps/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/spectra/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/test_pickle.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/test_profiling.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/test_utils.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/test_wcs.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/test_wcsprm.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/utils.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/wcs.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/wcslint.py"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think></think>\nNow let me examine the main WCS file where the error occurs:\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/wcs.py</parameter>\n<parameter=view_range>[1350, 1360]</parameter>\n<parameter=security_risk>LOW</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nHere's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/wcs.py:\n  1350\t        if self.wcs is None:\n  1351\t            raise ValueError(\"No basic WCS settings were created.\")\n  1352\t        return self._array_converter(\n  1353\t            lambda xy, o: self.wcs.p2s(xy, o)['world'],\n  1354\t            'output', *args, **kwargs)\n  1355\t    wcs_pix2world.__doc__ = \"\"\"\n  1356\t        Transforms pixel coordinates to world coordinates by doing\n  1357\t        only the basic `wcslib`_ transformation.\n  1358\t\n  1359\t        No `SIP`_ or `distortion paper`_ table lookup correction is\n  1360\t        applied.

I've successfully reproduced the issue. Now let me analyze the problem and implement a fix.\n\n## Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS\n\n<function=think>\n<parameter=thought>Let me analyze the problem clearly:\n\n**5.1 What the problem is:**\nWhen empty lists/arrays are passed to `wcs_pix2world()`, the function fails with an `InconsistentAxisTypesError` instead of returning empty lists/arrays as expected.\n\n**5.2 Where the problem is located:**\nThe issue is in the `_return_list_of_arrays` function within `_array_converter` method in `/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/wcs.py`. Specifically:\n- Line 1221: `xy = np.hstack([x.reshape((x.size, 1)) for x in axes])`\n- Line 1225: `output = func(xy, origin)` where `func` is `lambda xy, o: self.wcs.p2s(xy, o)['world']`\n\nWhen axes contain empty arrays, `x.size` is 0, so `x.reshape((0, 1))` creates arrays with shape (0, 1). The `np.hstack` then creates an array with shape (0, naxis). When this empty array is passed to the underlying wcslib function `p2s()`, it fails because the coordinate dimensions are inconsistent with the WCS parameters.\n\n**5.3 How the test reproduces the issue:**\nThe test creates empty lists/arrays and passes them to `wcs_pix2world()`. This triggers the `_array_converter` -> `_return_list_of_arrays` path, which creates an empty coordinate array that causes the underlying wcslib to fail.\n\n**5.4 Best practices for the fix:**\n- Handle empty inputs early, before calling the underlying wcslib functions\n- Return empty arrays with the correct shape and type\n- Maintain API consistency - empty inputs should return empty outputs\n- Minimal changes to avoid breaking existing functionality\n- Preserve the behavior for non-empty inputs\n\n**5.5 How to fix the problem:**\nAdd a check in `_return_list_of_arrays` to detect when all input arrays are empty. If they are, return empty arrays with the appropriate shapes without calling the underlying wcslib function. The fix should:\n1. Check if all input arrays are empty (size == 0)\n2. If so, return empty arrays with the same shape as the input arrays\n3. Otherwise, proceed with the normal logic\n\nThis approach handles the edge case gracefully while preserving all existing functionality.</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [think]:\nYour thought has been logged."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think></think>\n## Phase 6.

First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* If working in a git repo, before you commit code create a .gitignore file if one doesn't exist. And if there are existing files that should not be included then update the .gitignore file as appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT>\n# \ud83d\udd10 Security Risk Policy\nWhen using tools that support the security_risk parameter, assess the safety risk of your actions:\n\n\n- **LOW**: Read-only actions inside sandbox.\n  - Inspecting container files, calculations, viewing docs.\n- **MEDIUM**: Container-scoped edits and installs.\n  - Modify workspace files, install packages system-wide inside container, run user code.\n- **HIGH**: Data exfiltration or privilege breaks.\n  - Sending secrets/local data out, connecting to host filesystem, privileged container ops, running unverified binaries with network access.\n\n\n\n**Global Rules**\n- Always escalate to **HIGH** if sensitive data leaves the environment.\n</SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>\n* IMPORTANT: If you were using the task_tracker tool before a condensation event, continue using it after condensation\n* Check condensation summaries for TASK_TRACKING sections to maintain continuity\n* If you see a condensation event with TASK_TRACKING, immediately use task_tracker to view and continue managing them\n</TASK_TRACKING_PERSISTENCE>", "role": "system"}, {"content": "<uploaded_files>\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3\n</uploaded_files>\n\nI've uploaded a python code repository in the directory astropy__astropy__1.3.

The error occurs because the underlying WCS library (wcslib) expects coordinate dimensions to match the WCS parameters, but empty arrays don't provide the expected structure.\n\n**1.4 Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Import WCS from astropy.wcs\n2. Create a WCS object from a FITS file (e.g., '2MASS_h.fits')\n3. Call `wcs.wcs_pix2world([], [], 0)` with empty lists\n4. Observe the `InconsistentAxisTypesError`\n\n**1.5 Best Practices:**\n- Handle edge cases gracefully (empty inputs)\n- Maintain API consistency - empty inputs should return empty outputs\n- Minimal changes to avoid breaking existing functionality\n- Test with various input types (lists, arrays, different dimensions)\n\nLet me now explore the WCS module:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_02", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"view\", \"path\": \"/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs\", \"security_risk\": \"LOW\"}"}}]}, {"content": "Here's the files and directories up to 2 levels deep in /workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs, excluding hidden items:\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__init__.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__pycache__/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-36.pyc\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__pycache__/_docutil.cpython-36.pyc\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__pycache__/docstrings.cpython-36.pyc\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__pycache__/setup_package.cpython-36.pyc\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/__pycache__/wcs.cpython-36.pyc\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/_docutil.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/_wcs.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/docstrings.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/include/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/include/astropy_wcs/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/include/astropy_wcs_api.h\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/include/wcsconfig.h\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/include/wcslib/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/setup_package.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/astropy_wcs.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/astropy_wcs_api.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/distortion.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/distortion_wrap.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/docstrings.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/pipeline.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/pyutil.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/sip.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/sip_wrap.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/str_list_proxy.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/unit_list_proxy.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/util.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/wcslib_tabprm_wrap.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/src/wcslib_wrap.c\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/__init__.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/data/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/extension/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/maps/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/spectra/\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/test_pickle.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/test_profiling.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/test_utils.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/test_wcs.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/tests/test_wcsprm.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/utils.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/wcs.py\n/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/wcslint.py", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_02", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, {"content": "<think></think>\nNow let me examine the main WCS file where the error occurs:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_03", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"view\", \"path\": \"/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/wcs.py\", \"view_range\": [1350, 1360], \"security_risk\": \"LOW\"}"}}]}, {"content": "Here's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/wcs.py:\n  1350\t        if self.wcs is None:\n  1351\t            raise ValueError(\"No basic WCS settings were created.\")\n  1352\t        return self._array_converter(\n  1353\t            lambda xy, o: self.wcs.p2s(xy, o)['world'],\n  1354\t            'output', *args, **kwargs)\n  1355\t    wcs_pix2world.__doc__ = \"\"\"\n  1356\t        Transforms pixel coordinates to world coordinates by doing\n  1357\t        only the basic `wcslib`_ transformation.\n  1358\t\n  1359\t        No `SIP`_ or `distortion paper`_ table lookup correction is\n  1360\t        applied.

FIX ANALYSIS", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_18", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "think", "arguments": "{\"thought\": \"Let me analyze the problem clearly:\\n\\n**5.1 What the problem is:**\\nWhen empty lists/arrays are passed to `wcs_pix2world()`, the function fails with an `InconsistentAxisTypesError` instead of returning empty lists/arrays as expected.\\n\\n**5.2 Where the problem is located:**\\nThe issue is in the `_return_list_of_arrays` function within `_array_converter` method in `/workspace/astropy__astropy__1.3/astropy/wcs/wcs.py`. Specifically:\\n- Line 1221: `xy = np.hstack([x.reshape((x.size, 1)) for x in axes])`\\n- Line 1225: `output = func(xy, origin)` where `func` is `lambda xy, o: self.wcs.p2s(xy, o)['world']`\\n\\nWhen axes contain empty arrays, `x.size` is 0, so `x.reshape((0, 1))` creates arrays with shape (0, 1). The `np.hstack` then creates an array with shape (0, naxis). When this empty array is passed to the underlying wcslib function `p2s()`, it fails because the coordinate dimensions are inconsistent with the WCS parameters.\\n\\n**5.3 How the test reproduces the issue:**\\nThe test creates empty lists/arrays and passes them to `wcs_pix2world()`. This triggers the `_array_converter` -> `_return_list_of_arrays` path, which creates an empty coordinate array that causes the underlying wcslib to fail.\\n\\n**5.4 Best practices for the fix:**\\n- Handle empty inputs early, before calling the underlying wcslib functions\\n- Return empty arrays with the correct shape and type\\n- Maintain API consistency - empty inputs should return empty outputs\\n- Minimal changes to avoid breaking existing functionality\\n- Preserve the behavior for non-empty inputs\\n\\n**5.5 How to fix the problem:**\\nAdd a check in `_return_list_of_arrays` to detect when all input arrays are empty. If they are, return empty arrays with the appropriate shapes without calling the underlying wcslib function. The fix should:\\n1. Check if all input arrays are empty (size == 0)\\n2. If so, return empty arrays with the same shape as the input arrays\\n3. Otherwise, proceed with the normal logic\\n\\nThis approach handles the edge case gracefully while preserving all existing functionality.\"}"}}]}, {"content": "Your thought has been logged.", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_18", "name": "think"}, {"content": "<think></think>\n## Phase 6.
