Let me analyze what's happening:\nThe problem is in the `_cstack` function. When we have a nested compound model like `Pix2Sky_TAN() & (Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5))`, the `_cstack` function receives:\n\n- left: Pix2Sky_TAN() with separability matrix [[1, 1], [1, 1]] (2x2)\n- right: (Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5)) with separability matrix [[1, 0], [0, 1]] (2x2)\n\nThe issue is in lines 244-245 of `_cstack`:\n```python\ncright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))\ncright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1\n```\n\nThis sets the entire bottom-right block to 1s, but it should preserve the actual separability matrix from the right side. The right side should be placed in the bottom-right corner, but with its original separability pattern preserved.\n\nFor the nested case, we get:\n```\n[[1, 1, 0, 0],\n [1, 1, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 1],  <- This should be [0, 0, 1, 0]\n [0, 0, 1, 1]]  <- This should be [0, 0, 0, 1]\n```\n\nBut for the equivalent non-nested case, the computation happens in two steps:\n1. First: Pix2Sky_TAN() & Linear1D(10) -> correct separability\n2.
