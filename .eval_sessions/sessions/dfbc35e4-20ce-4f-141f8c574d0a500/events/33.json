When we have a nested compound model like `Pix2Sky_TAN() & (Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5))`, the `_cstack` function receives:\\n\\n- left: Pix2Sky_TAN() with separability matrix [[1, 1], [1, 1]] (2x2)\\n- right: (Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5)) with separability matrix [[1, 0], [0, 1]] (2x2)\\n\\nThe issue is in lines 244-245 of `_cstack`:\\n```python\\ncright = np.zeros((noutp, right.shape[1]))\\ncright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1\\n```\\n\\nThis sets the entire bottom-right block to 1s, but it should preserve the actual separability matrix from the right side. The right side should be placed in the bottom-right corner, but with its original separability pattern preserved.\\n\\nFor the nested case, we get:\\n```\\n[[1, 1, 0, 0],\\n [1, 1, 0, 0], \\n [0, 0, 1, 1],  <- This should be [0, 0, 1, 0]\\n [0, 0, 1, 1]]  <- This should be [0, 0, 0, 1]\\n```\\n\\nBut for the equivalent non-nested case, the computation happens in two steps:\\n1. First: Pix2Sky_TAN() & Linear1D(10) -> correct separability\\n2. Then: (result) & Linear1D(5) -> correct separability\\n\\nThe fix is to change line 245 from:\\n```python\\ncright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = 1\\n```\\nto:\\n```python\\ncright[-right.shape[0]:, -right.shape[1]:] = right\\n```\\n\\nThis will preserve the actual separability matrix from the right side instead of just setting everything to 1.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_14", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 486, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 486, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
