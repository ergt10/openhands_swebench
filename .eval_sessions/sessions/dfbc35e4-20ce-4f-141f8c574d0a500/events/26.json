I've successfully reproduced the issue. Now let me analyze what's happening:\n\n## Phase 1. READING: Problem Analysis\n\n**1.1 Problem Description:**\nThe issue is with the `separability_matrix` function in the modeling module. When dealing with nested CompoundModels, the separability matrix is computed incorrectly.\n\n**1.2 Technical Details:**\n- Method: `separability_matrix()` in `/workspace/astropy__astropy__4.3/astropy/modeling/separable.py`\n- Classes involved: `CompoundModel`, `Linear1D`, `Pix2Sky_TAN`\n- Operators: `&` (stacking operator)\n\n**1.3 Problem Explanation:**\nWhen we have a nested compound model like `Pix2Sky_TAN() & (Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5))`, the separability matrix incorrectly shows that the two Linear1D models are not separable from each other (they should be independent). The matrix shows `[[False, False, True, True], [False, False, True, True]]` for the last two rows, but it should show `[[False, False, True, False], [False, False, False, True]]`.\n\n**1.4 Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Create a simple compound model: `cm = Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5)`\n2. Create a nested compound model: `Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm`\n3. Compare the separability matrix with the equivalent non-nested model: `Pix2Sky_TAN() & Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5)`\n4. The results should be identical but they're not\n\n**1.5 Best Practices:**\n- The fix should maintain backward compatibility\n- The solution should handle arbitrary nesting levels\n- The fix should be minimal and focused\n\n## Phase 2. RUNNING: Environment Setup\n\nThe environment is already set up and I can run the reproduction script successfully.\n\n## Phase 3.
