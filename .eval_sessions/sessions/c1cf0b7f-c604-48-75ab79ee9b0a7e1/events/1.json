Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\ntmpdir creation fails when the username contains illegal characters for directory names\n`tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory` and `tmp_path_factory` rely on `getpass.getuser()` for determining the `basetemp` directory. I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3 directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1.

RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 4964b468c83c06971eb743fbc57cc404f760c573.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning.
