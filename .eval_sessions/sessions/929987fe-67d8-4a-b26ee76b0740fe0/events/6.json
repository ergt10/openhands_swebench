Let me start by following the phases systematically.\n\n## Phase 1. READING: Understanding the Problem", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"thought\": \"\\nLet me analyze the issue description:\\n\\n1.1 Code/config snippets analysis:\\n- The user is trying to configure function-rgx in .pylintrc with `[\\\\p{Han}a-z_][\\\\p{Han}a-z0-9_]{2,30}$`\\n- This regex pattern includes `\\\\p{Han}` which is a Unicode property escape for Han (Chinese) characters\\n- The pattern is intended to allow function names that start with Han characters, a-z, or underscore, followed by 2-30 characters from Han, a-z, 0-9, or underscore\\n\\n1.2 Technical details from error:\\n- Error message: `re.error: bad escape \\\\p at position 1`\\n- Stack trace shows the error occurs in `re.py` during regex compilation\\n- The error happens during configuration parsing in `arguments_manager.py` line 244\\n- The specific call chain: `_parse_configuration_file` -> `parse_known_args` -> `_get_values` -> `type_func` (which is `re.compile`)\\n\\n1.3 Problem explanation:\\nThe issue is that Python's built-in `re` module doesn't support Unicode property escapes like `\\\\p{Han}`. This is a feature that exists in some regex engines (like PCRE, Java, .NET) but not in Python's standard `re` module. When pylint tries to compile the regex pattern containing `\\\\p{Han}`, it fails because Python's `re` module doesn't recognize this escape sequence.\\n\\n1.4 Steps to reproduce:\\n1. Create a .pylintrc file with `function-rgx=[\\\\p{Han}a-z_][\\\\p{Han}a-z0-9_]{2,30}$`\\n2. Run pylint on any Python file\\n3. Pylint will crash with `re.error: bad escape \\\\p at position 1`\\n\\n1.5 Best practices for testing and fixing:\\n- Need to handle Unicode property escapes gracefully\\n- Should provide a clear error message or alternative solution\\n- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing regex patterns\\n- Should test with various Unicode property patterns\\n- Need to ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 514, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 514, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
