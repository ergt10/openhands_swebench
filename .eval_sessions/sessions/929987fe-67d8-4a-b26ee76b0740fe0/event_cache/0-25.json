The runtime may not support them and can cause unusable shell sessions.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4.

Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The following binary file extensions can be viewed in Markdown format: [\".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"].

Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

Let me start by following the phases systematically.\n\n## Phase 1. READING: Understanding the Problem\n\nLet me analyze the issue description:\n\n1.1 Code/config snippets analysis:\n- The user is trying to configure function-rgx in .pylintrc with `[\\p{Han}a-z_][\\p{Han}a-z0-9_]{2,30}$`\n- This regex pattern includes `\\p{Han}` which is a Unicode property escape for Han (Chinese) characters\n- The pattern is intended to allow function names that start with Han characters, a-z, or underscore, followed by 2-30 characters from Han, a-z, 0-9, or underscore\n\n1.2 Technical details from error:\n- Error message: `re.error: bad escape \\p at position 1`\n- Stack trace shows the error occurs in `re.py` during regex compilation\n- The error happens during configuration parsing in `arguments_manager.py` line 244\n- The specific call chain: `_parse_configuration_file` -> `parse_known_args` -> `_get_values` -> `type_func` (which is `re.compile`)\n\n1.3 Problem explanation:\nThe issue is that Python's built-in `re` module doesn't support Unicode property escapes like `\\p{Han}`. This is a feature that exists in some regex engines (like PCRE, Java, .NET) but not in Python's standard `re` module. When pylint tries to compile the regex pattern containing `\\p{Han}`, it fails because Python's `re` module doesn't recognize this escape sequence.\n\n1.4 Steps to reproduce:\n1. Create a .pylintrc file with `function-rgx=[\\p{Han}a-z_][\\p{Han}a-z0-9_]{2,30}$`\n2. Run pylint on any Python file\n3. Pylint will crash with `re.error: bad escape \\p at position 1`\n\n1.5 Best practices for testing and fixing:\n- Need to handle Unicode property escapes gracefully\n- Should provide a clear error message or alternative solution\n- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing regex patterns\n- Should test with various Unicode property patterns\n- Need to ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n", "action": "think", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "think", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-72de19aa5fbd414dbc197bd47ce5bee4", "created": 1767715553, "model": "/mnt/shared/models/GLM-4.6-FP8", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "<think></think>\nI'll help you implement the necessary changes to fix the issue with `\\p{Han}` regex patterns in pylint.

The latest version supports Python\n    40\t3.7.2 and above.\n    41\t\n    42\t.. _`static code analyser`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_code_analysis\n    43\t\n    44\tPylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a\n    45\tcoding standard, looks for `code smells`_, and can make suggestions about how the code\n    46\tcould be refactored. Pylint can infer actual values from your code using its internal\n    47\tcode representation (astroid). If your code is ``import logging as argparse``, Pylint\n    48\twill know that ``argparse.error(...)`` is in fact a logging call and not an argparse call.\n    49\t\n    50\t.. _`code smells`: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html\n    51\t\n    52\tPylint is highly configurable and permits to write plugins in order to add your\n    53\town checks (for example, for internal libraries or an internal rule). Pylint has an\n    54\tecosystem of existing plugins for popular frameworks such as `pylint-django`_ or\n    55\t`pylint-sonarjson`_.\n    56\t\n    57\t.. _`pylint-django`: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django\n    58\t.. _`pylint-sonarjson`: https://github.com/omegacen/pylint-sonarjson\n    59\t\n    60\tPylint isn't smarter than you: it may warn you about things that you have\n    61\tconscientiously done or check for some things that you don't care about.\n    62\tDuring adoption, especially in a legacy project where pylint was never enforced,\n    63\tit's best to start with the ``--errors-only`` flag, then disable\n    64\tconvention and refactor message with ``--disable=C,R`` and progressively\n    65\tre-evaluate and re-enable messages as your priorities evolve.\n    66\t\n    67\tPylint ships with three additional tools:\n    68\t\n    69\t- pyreverse_ (standalone tool that generates package and class diagrams.)\n    70\t- symilar_  (duplicate code finder that is also integrated in pylint)\n    71\t- epylint_ (Emacs and Flymake compatible Pylint)\n    72\t\n    73\t.. _pyreverse: https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/pyreverse.html\n    74\t.. _symilar: https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/symilar.html\n    75\t.. _epylint: https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/ide_integration/flymake-emacs.html\n    76\t\n    77\tProjects that you might want to use alongside pylint include flake8_ (faster and simpler checks\n    78\twith very few false positives), mypy_, pyright_ or pyre_ (typing checks), bandit_ (security\n    79\toriented checks), black_ and isort_ (auto-formatting), autoflake_ (automated removal of\n    80\tunused imports or variables), pyupgrade_ (automated upgrade to newer python syntax) and\n    81\tpydocstringformatter_ (automated pep257).\n    82\t\n    83\t.. _flake8: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/\n    84\t.. _bandit: https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit\n    85\t.. _mypy: https://github.com/python/mypy\n    86\t.. _pyright: https://github.com/microsoft/pyright\n    87\t.. _pyre: https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check\n    88\t.. _black: https://github.com/psf/black\n    89\t.. _autoflake: https://github.com/myint/autoflake\n    90\t.. _pyupgrade: https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade\n    91\t.. _pydocstringformatter: https://github.com/DanielNoord/pydocstringformatter\n    92\t.. _isort: https://pycqa.github.io/isort/\n    93\t\n    94\t..
