Let me analyze the problem:\n\n## Phase 1. READING: Problem Analysis\n\n**1.1 Problem Description:**\nThe issue is that `socket.error` exceptions are not being caught and wrapped in `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` when they occur during response content reading. The stack trace shows that a `socket.error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer` is being raised directly from the socket layer instead of being wrapped in a requests exception.\n\n**1.2 Technical Details:**\n- **Error message:** `socket.error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer`\n- **Stack trace location:** The error occurs in `models.py` in the `iter_content` method when calling `self.raw.stream()`\n- **Method names:** `iter_content`, `content`, `text` properties\n- **File names:** `requests/models.py`, `requests/adapters.py`, `requests/exceptions.py`\n\n**1.3 Problem Explanation:**\nThe socket error handling in `adapters.py` only catches socket errors during the initial request sending phase (lines 389-390), but it doesn't catch socket errors that occur later when reading the response content through the `iter_content` method in `models.py`.\n\n**1.4 Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Make a request to a server\n2. The server resets the connection during content reading (not during initial request)\n3. Access `response.text` or `response.content` which triggers `iter_content`\n4. Socket error is raised directly instead of being wrapped in ConnectionError\n\n**1.5 Best Practices:**\n- All socket-level errors should be wrapped in appropriate requests exceptions\n- Exception handling should be consistent across the entire request/response lifecycle\n- The fix should be minimal and focused\n\n## Phase 2.
