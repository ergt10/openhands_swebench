Problem: Currently matplotlib only exposes `__version__` which is a string. For version comparisons, this is not ideal because string comparisons don't work well for version numbers (e.g., \\\"3.10\\\" vs \\\"3.2\\\" - string comparison would say \\\"3.10\\\" < \\\"3.2\\\" which is wrong).\\n\\n2. Proposed solutions:\\n   - `version_info` tuple (like Python's sys.version_info) - can be compared with other tuples\\n   - `LooseVersion` instance - can be properly compared with other strings\\n\\n3. The user prefers `LooseVersion` but notes that `version_info` is more common in other packages.\\n\\n4. This should be exposed at the toplevel of matplotlib for easy access.\\n\\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure to understand how version information is currently handled.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 226, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 226, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
