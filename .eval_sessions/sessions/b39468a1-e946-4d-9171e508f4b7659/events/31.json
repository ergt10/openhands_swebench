Let me analyze what I've found:\\n\\n1. **Current state**: matplotlib only exposes `__version__` as a string at the toplevel\\n2. **Available data**: The `_version.py` file already has `__version_tuple__` which contains a tuple like `(3, 5, 0, 'dev1324', 'gb7d0591986')`\\n3. **Problem**: Users want easily comparable version info at the toplevel\\n4. **Options**: \\n   - `version_info` tuple (like Python's sys.version_info) - can be compared with other tuples\\n   - `LooseVersion` instance - but distutils.LooseVersion is deprecated, packaging.version.Version is the modern replacement\\n\\nThe issue mentions both `version_info` and `LooseVersion`, but given that:\\n- `version_info` is more common in other packages\\n- `LooseVersion` is deprecated in favor of `packaging.version.Version`\\n- matplotlib already imports `packaging.version.parse` in `__init__.py`\\n\\nI think the best approach is to expose both:\\n1. `version_info` - a tuple for easy comparison (similar to sys.version_info)\\n2. A `Version` instance from packaging.version for proper version comparison\\n\\nLet me look at how other packages do this and then implement the solution.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_13", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 298, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 298, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
