The runtime may not support them and can cause unusable shell sessions.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nCalibratedClassifierCV doesn't work with `set_config(transform_output=\"pandas\")`\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nCalibratedClassifierCV with isotonic regression doesn't work when we previously set `set_config(transform_output=\"pandas\")`.\r\nThe IsotonicRegression seems to return a dataframe, which is a problem for `_CalibratedClassifier`  in `predict_proba` where it tries to put the dataframe in a numpy array row `proba[:, class_idx] = calibrator.predict(this_pred)`.\r\n\r\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn import set_config\r\nfrom sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier\r\n\r\nset_config(transform_output=\"pandas\")\r\nmodel = CalibratedClassifierCV(SGDClassifier(), method='isotonic')\r\nmodel.fit(np.arange(90).reshape(30, -1), np.arange(30) % 2)\r\nmodel.predict(np.arange(90).reshape(30, -1))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Results\r\n\r\nIt should not crash.\r\n\r\n### Actual Results\r\n\r\n```\r\n../core/model_trainer.py:306: in
