Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nCalibratedClassifierCV doesn't work with `set_config(transform_output=\"pandas\")`\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nCalibratedClassifierCV with isotonic regression doesn't work when we previously set `set_config(transform_output=\"pandas\")`.\r\nThe IsotonicRegression seems to return a dataframe, which is a problem for `_CalibratedClassifier`  in `predict_proba` where it tries to put the dataframe in a numpy array row `proba[:, class_idx] = calibrator.predict(this_pred)`.\r\n\r\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn import set_config\r\nfrom sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier\r\n\r\nset_config(transform_output=\"pandas\")\r\nmodel = CalibratedClassifierCV(SGDClassifier(), method='isotonic')\r\nmodel.fit(np.arange(90).reshape(30, -1), np.arange(30) % 2)\r\nmodel.predict(np.arange(90).reshape(30, -1))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Results\r\n\r\nIt should not crash.\r\n\r\n### Actual Results\r\n\r\n```\r\n../core/model_trainer.py:306: in
