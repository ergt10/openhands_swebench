The problem is likely in how Django processes and displays the help text for management commands.\\n\\nKey technical details:\\n- Method names: BaseCommand, help attribute\\n- File names: Likely in django/core/management/ directory\\n- The issue is with help text formatting, not command functionality\\n- This affects the `./manage.py help <command>` output\\n\\nSteps to reproduce:\\n1. Create a management command with multi-line indented help text\\n2. Run `./manage.py help <command>`\\n3. Observe that line breaks and indentation are lost\\n\\nBest practices for fixing:\\n- Minimal changes to preserve existing functionality\\n- Ensure backward compatibility\\n- Test with various help text formats\\n- Follow Django's coding conventions\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_03", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 389, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 389, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
