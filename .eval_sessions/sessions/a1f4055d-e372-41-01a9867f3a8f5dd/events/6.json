The problem occurs when using persistent SQLite databases for tests (with --keepdb flag)\\n2. The specific error is \\\"sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked\\\"\\n3. This happens in the admin_views.test_multidb test when creating test data\\n4. The issue only occurs when using TEST[\\\"NAME\\\"] with specific database names for both 'default' and 'other' databases\\n5. It works fine when only using TEST[\\\"NAME\\\"] with \\\"default\\\" database\\n\\nThe error occurs during setUpClass when trying to create a superuser, specifically during the user.save() operation. This suggests there's a database locking issue when multiple database connections are trying to access the same persistent database files.\\n\\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure and understanding how Django handles multi-database testing with SQLite.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 216, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
