The runtime may not support them and can cause unusable shell sessions.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4.

Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The following binary file extensions can be viewed in Markdown format: [\".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"].

Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

"stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "<think></think>\nNow I understand the problem clearly. Let me analyze what needs to be fixed:\n\n## Phase 1. READING: Understanding the Problem\n\n### 1.1 Problem Description\nWhen a `functools.partial` object is passed as the view to `ResolverMatch`, the `__repr__()` method shows it as `functools.partial` instead of revealing the underlying function and its pre-bound arguments.\n\n### 1.2 Technical Details\n- **Class**: `ResolverMatch` in `/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/urls/resolvers.py`\n- **Method**: `__init__()` and `__repr__()`\n- **Issue**: The `_func_path` attribute is set to `functools.partial` when the func is a partial object\n\n### 1.3 Problem Explanation\nThe `ResolverMatch.__init__()` method doesn't handle `functools.partial` objects specially. It treats them as regular callable objects, resulting in an unhelpful representation that doesn't show the actual underlying function or its pre-bound arguments.\n\n### 1.4 Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a partial function using `functools.partial`\n2. Pass it to `ResolverMatch`\n3. Call `repr()` on the ResolverMatch instance\n4. The output shows `func=functools.partial` instead of the actual function\n\n### 1.5 Best Practices\n- The fix should unwrap partial objects to show the underlying function\n- Pre-bound arguments from the partial should be merged with the args/kwargs\n- The solution should be minimal and not break existing functionality\n\n## Phase 2. RUNNING: Environment Setup\nThe environment is already set up as mentioned.\n\n## Phase 3. EXPLORATION: Finding Related Files\n\nThe main file to fix is `/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/urls/resolvers.py`, specifically the `ResolverMatch` class.\n\n## Phase 4. TEST CREATION: Already Done\nI've created `/workspace/test_partial_repr.py` which reproduces the issue.\n\n## Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS\n\n### 5.1 The Problem\nThe `ResolverMatch.__init__()` method doesn't unwrap `functools.partial` objects when setting `_func_path`.\n\n### 5.2 Location\nLines 48-53 in `/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/urls/resolvers.py`\n\n### 5.3 Test Reproduction\nThe test shows that when a partial is passed, the repr shows `func=functools.partial` instead of the actual function.\n\n### 5.4 Best Practices\n- Unwrap partial objects to get the underlying function\n- Merge pre-bound arguments with the provided args/kwargs\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n\n### 5.5 Solution\nIn `ResolverMatch.__init__()`, check if `func` is a `functools.partial` object. If so:\n1. Unwrap it to get the underlying function for `_func_path`\n2. Merge the partial's pre-bound args and keywords with the provided args and kwargs\n\n## Phase 6.

Let me analyze what needs to be fixed:\n\n## Phase 1. READING: Understanding the Problem\n\n### 1.1 Problem Description\nWhen a `functools.partial` object is passed as the view to `ResolverMatch`, the `__repr__()` method shows it as `functools.partial` instead of revealing the underlying function and its pre-bound arguments.\n\n### 1.2 Technical Details\n- **Class**: `ResolverMatch` in `/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/urls/resolvers.py`\n- **Method**: `__init__()` and `__repr__()`\n- **Issue**: The `_func_path` attribute is set to `functools.partial` when the func is a partial object\n\n### 1.3 Problem Explanation\nThe `ResolverMatch.__init__()` method doesn't handle `functools.partial` objects specially. It treats them as regular callable objects, resulting in an unhelpful representation that doesn't show the actual underlying function or its pre-bound arguments.\n\n### 1.4 Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a partial function using `functools.partial`\n2. Pass it to `ResolverMatch`\n3. Call `repr()` on the ResolverMatch instance\n4. The output shows `func=functools.partial` instead of the actual function\n\n### 1.5 Best Practices\n- The fix should unwrap partial objects to show the underlying function\n- Pre-bound arguments from the partial should be merged with the args/kwargs\n- The solution should be minimal and not break existing functionality\n\n## Phase 2. RUNNING: Environment Setup\nThe environment is already set up as mentioned.\n\n## Phase 3. EXPLORATION: Finding Related Files\n\nThe main file to fix is `/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/urls/resolvers.py`, specifically the `ResolverMatch` class.\n\n## Phase 4. TEST CREATION: Already Done\nI've created `/workspace/test_partial_repr.py` which reproduces the issue.\n\n## Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS\n\n### 5.1 The Problem\nThe `ResolverMatch.__init__()` method doesn't unwrap `functools.partial` objects when setting `_func_path`.\n\n### 5.2 Location\nLines 48-53 in `/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/urls/resolvers.py`\n\n### 5.3 Test Reproduction\nThe test shows that when a partial is passed, the repr shows `func=functools.partial` instead of the actual function.\n\n### 5.4 Best Practices\n- Unwrap partial objects to get the underlying function\n- Merge pre-bound arguments with the provided args/kwargs\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n\n### 5.5 Solution\nIn `ResolverMatch.__init__()`, check if `func` is a `functools.partial` object. If so:\n1. Unwrap it to get the underlying function for `_func_path`\n2. Merge the partial's pre-bound args and keywords with the provided args and kwargs\n\n## Phase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION\n\nLet me implement the fix:", "security_risk": 0, "impl_source": "oh_aci"}}]
