This causes method selection issues where a POST request that should be converted to GET (due to 303) gets reverted back to POST in subsequent redirects (like 307).\n\n1.4 **Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Make a POST request\n2. Receive 303 See Other redirect (should convert POST to GET)\n3. Follow redirect with GET request  \n4. Receive 307 Temporary Redirect (should preserve GET method)\n5. Bug: Instead of GET, it issues POST because it copies the original request\n\n1.5 **Best Practices:**\n- HTTP redirect method handling should follow RFC standards\n- Each redirect should build upon the previous request, not the original\n- Method changes should be preserved through the redirect chain\n\nLet me now look at the README to understand how to run tests:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"view\", \"path\": \"/workspace/psf__requests__2.3/README.rst\", \"security_risk\": \"LOW\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "toolu_02", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 351, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 351, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Here's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/psf__requests__2.3/README.rst:\n     1\tRequests: HTTP for Humans\n     2\t=========================\n     3\t\n     4\t.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/requests.png\n     5\t    :target: http://badge.fury.io/py/requests\n     6\t\n     7\t.. image:: https://pypip.in/d/requests/badge.png\n     8\t        :target: https://crate.io/packages/requests/\n     9\t\n    10\t\n    11\tRequests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for human\n    12\tbeings.\n    13\t\n    14\tMost existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely\n    15\tverbose and cumbersome.
