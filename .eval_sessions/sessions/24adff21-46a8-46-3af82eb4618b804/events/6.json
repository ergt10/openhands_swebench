The user is trying to access `plt.style.library[\\\"seaborn-colorblind\\\"]` but getting a KeyError. This suggests that between versions 3.4.3 and 3.6.1, this style was either removed, renamed, or not properly loaded into the style library.\\n\\nKey technical details:\\n- Error: KeyError: 'seaborn-colorblind'\\n- Code: `plt.style.library[\\\"seaborn-colorblind\\\"]`\\n- Working in v3.4.3, broken in v3.6.1\\n- Affects both MacOSX and Ubuntu\\n\\nThe problem is clear: the seaborn-colorblind style is not available in the style library in matplotlib 3.6.1, but it should be for backward compatibility.\\n\\nSteps to reproduce:\\n1. Import matplotlib.pyplot\\n2. Try to access plt.style.library[\\\"seaborn-colorblind\\\"]\\n3. Get KeyError\\n\\nBest practices for fixing:\\n- Ensure backward compatibility\\n- Check if this is a deprecated style that should still be available\\n- Look at how other seaborn styles are handled\\n- Make minimal changes to restore functionality\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 337, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 337, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
