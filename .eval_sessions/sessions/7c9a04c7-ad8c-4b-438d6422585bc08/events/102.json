I've successfully reproduced the issue. The problem is clear now:\n\n1. When a figure is unpickled, `FigureCanvasBase(fig)` is called in `__setstate__`\n2. This sets `figure._original_dpi = figure.dpi` (line 1656 in backend_bases.py)\n3. But the figure's DPI has already been potentially doubled from previous iterations\n4. Then when `_set_device_pixel_ratio(2.0)` is called, it calculates `dpi = ratio * self.figure._original_dpi`\n5. Since `_original_dpi` was set to the already-doubled DPI, the new DPI becomes doubled again\n\nThe fix is to preserve the original `_original_dpi` value during pickling and restore it during unpickling.\n\nLet me implement the fix:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"str_replace\", \"path\": \"/workspace/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5/lib/matplotlib/figure.py\", \"old_str\": \"def __getstate__(self):\\n        state = super().__getstate__()\\n\\n        # The canvas cannot currently be pickled, but this has the benefit\\n        # of meaning that a figure can be detached from one canvas, and\\n        # re-attached to another.\\n        state.pop(\\\"canvas\\\")\\n\\n        # Set cached renderer to None -- it can't be pickled.\\n        state[\\\"_cachedRenderer\\\"] = None\\n\\n        # add version information to the state\\n        state['__mpl_version__'] = mpl.__version__\\n\\n        # check whether the figure manager (if any) is registered with pyplot\\n        from matplotlib import _pylab_helpers\\n        if self.canvas.manager in _pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs.values():\\n            state['_restore_to_pylab'] = True\\n        return state\", \"new_str\": \"def __getstate__(self):\\n        state = super().__getstate__()\\n\\n        # The canvas cannot currently be pickled, but this has the benefit\\n        # of meaning that a figure can be detached from one canvas, and\\n        # re-attached to another.\\n        state.pop(\\\"canvas\\\")\\n\\n        # Set cached renderer to None -- it can't be pickled.\\n        state[\\\"_cachedRenderer\\\"] = None\\n\\n        # Preserve _original_dpi to prevent DPI doubling on unpickling\\n        if hasattr(self, '_original_dpi'):\\n            state['_original_dpi'] = self._original_dpi\\n\\n        # add version information to the state\\n        state['__mpl_version__'] = mpl.__version__\\n\\n        # check whether the figure manager (if any) is registered with pyplot\\n        from matplotlib import _pylab_helpers\\n        if self.canvas.manager in _pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs.values():\\n            state['_restore_to_pylab'] = True\\n        return state\", \"security_risk\": \"LOW\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "toolu_48", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 603, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 603, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "The file /workspace/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5/lib/matplotlib/figure.py has been edited.
