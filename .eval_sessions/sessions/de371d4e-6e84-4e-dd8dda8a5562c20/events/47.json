Looking at the template autoreload code in `/workspace/django__django__4.1/django/template/autoreload.py`, the `get_template_directories()` function on line 22 does:\\n\\n```python\\nitems.update(cwd / to_path(dir) for dir in backend.engine.dirs)\\n```\\n\\nThe problem is that it's prepending `cwd` (current working directory) to every directory in `backend.engine.dirs`. When `BASE_DIR` is added to the TEMPLATES DIRS, `BASE_DIR` is typically an absolute path like `/path/to/project`. But the code is doing `cwd / to_path(dir)` which creates a path like `/current/working/dir/path/to/project`, which doesn't exist.\\n\\nThe issue is that the code assumes all directories in `backend.engine.dirs` are relative paths, but `BASE_DIR` is an absolute path. When you try to join an absolute path with another path using the `/` operator, it doesn't work as expected.\\n\\nThe fix should check if the directory is already absolute before prepending the current working directory.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_21", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 290, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 290, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
