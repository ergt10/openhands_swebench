The problem is with KeyTransformIsNull lookup in Django's JSON field functionality\\n2. When using `__isnull=True` on a KeyTransform, it should only match objects that do NOT have the key\\n3. However, on SQLite and Oracle, it also matches objects that have the key with JSON null value, which is incorrect\\n4. The issue is that KeyTransformIsNull borrows logic from HasKey for isnull=False (which is correct), but for isnull=True it should have different logic\\n5. The test case mentioned shows that the current test doesn't catch this because it uses a key that doesn't have JSON null values\\n\\nThe key technical details:\\n- Method: KeyTransformIsNull lookup\\n- Databases affected: SQLite and Oracle (MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL work correctly)\\n- Expected behavior: `__isnull=True` should only match objects without the key\\n- Actual behavior: `__isnull=True` matches objects without the key AND objects with the key having JSON null value\\n\\nI need to:\\n1. Find the KeyTransformIsNull implementation\\n2. Understand how it currently works\\n3. Fix the logic for isnull=True case on SQLite and Oracle\\n4.
