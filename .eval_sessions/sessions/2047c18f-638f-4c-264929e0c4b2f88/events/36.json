The problem is in the `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` function in `/workspace/django__django__4.2/django/core/checks/templates.py`\\n\\n2. The issue states that when you add a template tag library into TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['libraries'], the check incorrectly reports duplicate module names even when they're the same module.\\n\\n3. Looking at the code in lines 55-61:\\n   - It collects custom libraries from TEMPLATES settings (lines 55-58)\\n   - Then it gets template tag modules from installed apps (lines 60-61)\\n   - The problem is that if the same module is specified in multiple TEMPLATES configurations, it gets added multiple times\\n\\n4. The issue is that when the same module path is specified in multiple TEMPLATES configurations, it's being treated as a duplicate even though it's the same module.\\n\\n5. The fix should be to deduplicate the module paths before checking for conflicts.\\n\\nLet me look at the test case to understand better what the expected behavior should be.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_15", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 267, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 267, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
