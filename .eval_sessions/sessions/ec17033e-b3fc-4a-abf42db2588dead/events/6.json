The problem is that Django 3.2+ is raising models.W042 warnings for models that inherit from other models with manually specified primary keys\\n2. The warning suggests that auto-created primary keys are being used when the models should inherit the primary key from their parent\\n3. This worked fine in Django 3.1 but started failing in Django 3.2 alpha\\n4. The warning message indicates that Django thinks these models don't have a primary key defined, when they should inherit one from their parent\\n\\nKey technical details:\\n- Error code: models.W042\\n- Related to DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting\\n- Affects models that inherit from other models with manually specified primary keys\\n- The issue is in the model validation/checking system\\n\\nSteps to reproduce:\\n1. Create a parent model with a manually specified primary key\\n2. Create a child model that inherits from the parent\\n3. Run makemigrations or system checks\\n4. Observe the W042 warning for the child model\\n\\nBest practices for fixing:\\n- Need to understand how Django's model inheritance works for primary keys\\n- Need to find where the W042 warning is generated\\n- Should ensure that inherited primary keys are properly detected\\n- Should not break existing functionality\\n- Should be minimal and focused changes\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 321, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 321, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
