The problem is with Django's TextChoices and IntegerChoices when used with CharField or IntegerField\\n2. When creating a model instance with these choices, the field value returns an enum object instead of the underlying string/integer value\\n3. This causes inconsistency: freshly created instances return enum objects, but retrieved instances return the actual values\\n4. The test shows that `str(my_object.my_str_value)` returns \\\"MyChoice.FIRST_CHOICE\\\" instead of \\\"first\\\" for newly created objects\\n5.
