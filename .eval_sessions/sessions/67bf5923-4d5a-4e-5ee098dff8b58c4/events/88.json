Summary of Changes Made\n\n**Problem**: Django's `makemigrations` command was producing incorrect paths for inner classes, treating them as top-level classes instead of including their outer class

Applied**: \n- Line 270: Changed `self.value.__name__` to `self.value.__qualname__` for built-in types\n- Line 272: Changed `self.value.__name__` to `self.value.__qualname__` for regular
