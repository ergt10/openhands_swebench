Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nImprove handling of skip for module level\nThis is potentially about updating docs, updating error messages or introducing a new API.\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n\r\n`pos_only.py` is using Python 3,8 syntax:\r\n```python\r\ndef foo(a, /, b):\r\n    return a + b\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should not be tested under Python 3.6 and 3.7.\r\nThis is a proper way to skip the test in Python older than 3.8:\r\n```python\r\nfrom pytest import raises, skip\r\nimport sys\r\nif sys.version_info < (3, 8):\r\n    skip(msg=\"Requires Python >= 3.8\", allow_module_level=True)\r\n\r\n# import must be after the module level skip:\r\nfrom pos_only import *\r\n\r\ndef test_foo():\r\n    assert foo(10, 20) == 30\r\n    assert foo(10, b=20) == 30\r\n    with raises(TypeError):\r\n        assert foo(a=10, b=20)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy actual test involves parameterize and a 3.8 only class, so skipping the test itself is not sufficient because the 3.8 class was used in the parameterization.\r\n\r\nA naive user will try to initially skip the module like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif sys.version_info < (3, 8):\r\n    skip(msg=\"Requires Python >= 3.8\")\r\n```\r\nThis issues this error:\r\n\r\n>Using pytest.skip outside of a test is not allowed. To decorate a test function, use the @pytest.mark.skip or @pytest.mark.skipif decorators instead, and to skip a module use `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}`, does not work  in my case: pytest continues to process the file and fail when it hits the 3.8 syntax (when running with an older version of Python).\r\n\r\nThe correct solution, to use skip as a function is actively discouraged by the error message.\r\n\r\nThis area feels a bit unpolished.\r\nA few ideas to improve:\r\n\r\n1. Explain skip with  `allow_module_level` in the error message. this seems in conflict with the spirit of the message.\r\n2. Create an alternative API to skip a module to make things easier: `skip_module(\"reason\")`, which can call `_skip(msg=msg, allow_module_level=True)`.\r\n\r\n\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>.

RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8.
