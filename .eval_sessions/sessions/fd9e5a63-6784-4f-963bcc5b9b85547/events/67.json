However, this could cause recursion. A better approach is to ensure that callbacks are triggered for all shared axes when limits change, but without causing infinite recursion.\\n\\nThe fix should:\\n1. Trigger callbacks on shared axes when their limits change\\n2. Avoid recursion by carefully managing the emit parameter\\n3. Maintain the existing behavior for non-shared axes\\n\\n**Best practices to consider:**\\n1. Minimal changes to existing code\\n2. Avoid breaking existing functionality\\n3. Prevent infinite recursion\\n4.
