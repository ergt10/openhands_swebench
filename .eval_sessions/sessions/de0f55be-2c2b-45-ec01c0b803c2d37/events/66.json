The problem is that when `hue_order` contains only a subset of the actual hue values, the data still contains all the original values (including those not in `hue_order`), but the lookup table only contains the subset.

FIX ANALYSIS\n\n**5.1 Problem Statement:**\nWhen `hue_order` contains only a subset of the actual hue values in the data, the color mapping fails because it tries to look up values that aren't in the lookup table, leading to a TypeError when `np.isnan()` is called on string values.\n\n**5.2 Problem Location:**\nThe issue is in the PairGrid initialization in `axisgrid.py` around line 1281-1286.
