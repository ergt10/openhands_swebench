FINAL REVIEW\n\nLet me carefully review my changes against the original issue description and ensure everything is working correctly:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"thought\": \"Let me review what I've accomplished:\\n\\n1. **Issue Understanding**: The problem was that in seaborn 0.11.1, `pairplot` with `hue_order` containing only a subset of hue values would fail with a TypeError, instead of filtering out the unspecified categories as it did in older versions.\\n\\n2. **Root Cause**: The issue was in the PairGrid initialization where the data contained all original hue values, but the lookup table only contained the subset specified in hue_order. When the mapping tried to look up values not in the subset, it would fail.\\n\\n3. **Solution**: I implemented data filtering in PairGrid.__init__ to filter the dataset to only include rows where the hue value is in the specified hue_order, when hue_order is a subset of the actual data values.\\n\\n4. **Testing**: \\n   - The exact scenario from the issue description now works\\n   - All PairGrid tests pass\\n   - Comprehensive testing shows the fix works for various scenarios\\n   - Backward compatibility is maintained\\n\\n5. **Changes Made**:\\n   - Modified seaborn/axisgrid.py in PairGrid.__init__ to filter data when hue_order is a subset\\n   - Fixed a pandas compatibility issue in _oldcore.py (mode.use_inf_as_null)\\n\\nThe fix is minimal, focused, and addresses the exact issue described while maintaining backward compatibility.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_41", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 320, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 320, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
