The problem is that when `hue_order` contains only a subset of the actual hue values, the data still contains all the original values (including those not in `hue_order`), but the lookup table only contains the subset. When the mapping tries to look up a value not in the subset, it fails.\n\n## Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS\n\n**5.1 Problem Statement:**\nWhen `hue_order` contains only a subset of the actual hue values in the data, the color mapping fails because it tries to look up values that aren't in the lookup table, leading to a TypeError when `np.isnan()` is called on string values.\n\n**5.2 Problem Location:**\nThe issue is in the PairGrid initialization in `axisgrid.py` around line 1281-1286. The `hue_vals` still contains all original data values, but the `hue_names` (used for the lookup table) only contains the subset specified in `hue_order`.\n\n**5.3 Test Reproduction:**\nThe test script successfully reproduces the issue - when `hue_order=[\"setosa\", \"versicolor\"]` is used but the data also contains \"virginica\", the mapping fails when trying to color the \"virginica\" points.\n\n**5.4 Best Practices:**\n- Filter the data to only include rows with hue values in the specified `hue_order`\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Handle the filtering gracefully without breaking existing functionality\n\n**5.5 Fix Strategy:**\nFilter the data in PairGrid to only include rows where the hue value is in the specified `hue_order`. This ensures that only the desired categories are plotted, which was the intended behavior in older versions.\n\n## Phase 6.
