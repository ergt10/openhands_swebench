Let me analyze the problem:\\n\\n**Problem Analysis:**\\n1. **Location**: The issue is in `/workspace/django__django__3.1/django/db/models/fields/related.py` in the `ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model` method\\n2. **Specific lines**: Lines 1311-1312 and 1331-1332 contain the wrong hints\\n3. **The wrong hint**: `'use ForeignKey(\\\"%s\\\", symmetrical=False, through=\\\"%s\\\").'`\\n4. **Why it's wrong**: \\n   - `symmetrical` and `through` are ManyToManyField parameters, not ForeignKey parameters\\n   - ForeignKey doesn't accept these parameters\\n   - The hint should suggest ManyToManyField instead\\n\\n**Context:**\\n- This error occurs when there are multiple foreign keys in an intermediary model of a ManyToManyField\\n- The error codes are E334 (too many foreign keys from the model) and E335 (too many foreign keys to the model)\\n- The hint is trying to help users who might want to create a recursive relationship\\n\\n**The Fix:**\\nThe hint should suggest using ManyToManyField instead of ForeignKey:\\n- Change: `'use ForeignKey(\\\"%s\\\", symmetrical=False, through=\\\"%s\\\").'`\\n- To: `'use ManyToManyField(\\\"%s\\\", symmetrical=False, through=\\\"%s\\\").'`\\n\\nAlso, since Django 3.0, `symmetrical=False` is no longer required for recursive relationships with intermediary models, so we could remove that part, but the issue description specifically mentions fixing the ForeignKey vs ManyToManyField issue.\\n\\n**Test Analysis:**\\nLooking at the test in `tests/invalid_models_tests/test_relative_fields.py`, line 155, it expects the current (wrong) hint. This test will need to be updated to expect the correct hint.\\n\\nLet me proceed with the fix.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_30", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 406, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 406, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
