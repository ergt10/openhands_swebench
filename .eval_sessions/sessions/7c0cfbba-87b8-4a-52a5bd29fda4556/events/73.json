The current code checks:\\n\\n1. If item is callable -> OK\\n2. If obj (ModelAdmin) has the item as attribute -> OK  \\n3. Try to get field from model -> if fails, try getattr on model -> if that fails, return E108\\n\\nBut there's a problem with the order. The current logic checks hasattr(obj, item) BEFORE trying to get the field. This means if there's a method on the ModelAdmin with the same name as a non-existent field, it will pass the check even if the field doesn't exist.\\n\\nHowever, looking at our test case, \\\"choice\\\" is not a callable, not an attribute of QuestionAdmin, and not a field of Question model. So it should trigger the E108 error.\\n\\nLet me trace through what should happen:\\n1. item = \\\"choice\\\" (string, not callable) -> continue\\n2. hasattr(QuestionAdmin, \\\"choice\\\") -> should be False -> continue  \\n3. Question._meta.get_field(\\\"choice\\\") -> should raise FieldDoesNotExist -> continue\\n4. getattr(Question, \\\"choice\\\") -> should raise AttributeError -> should return E108\\n\\nBut it's not working. Let me check if there's something I'm missing. Maybe the issue is that the check is not being run at all, or there's a different code path being taken.\\n\\nLet me add some debugging to see what's happening in the check.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_31", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 324, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 324, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
