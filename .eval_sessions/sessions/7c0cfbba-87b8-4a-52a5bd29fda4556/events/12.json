However, when accessing the admin page `/admin/polls/question/`, it throws an `AttributeError: Unable to lookup 'choice' on Question or QuestionAdmin`.\n\n**1.2 Technical Details:**\n- **Error message**: `AttributeError: Unable to lookup 'choice' on Question or QuestionAdmin`\n- **Stack trace key locations**: \n  - `/django/contrib/admin/utils.py`, line 362, in `label_for_field`\n  - `/django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_list.py`, line 90, in `result_headers`\n  - `/django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_list.py`, line 326, in `result_list`\n- **Error code mentioned**: E108 (which should cover this case but doesn't)\n\n**1.3 Problem Explanation:**\nThe Django admin system should validate `list_display` entries during admin registration or startup, but it currently fails to detect invalid field references until runtime when the admin page is accessed. The error E108 is supposed to catch such cases but doesn't cover this specific scenario.\n\n**1.4 Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Create two models: Question and Choice\n2. Create QuestionAdmin with `list_display = [\"choice\"]` (where \"choice\" is not a valid field)\n3. Access `/admin/polls/question/` in the browser\n4.
