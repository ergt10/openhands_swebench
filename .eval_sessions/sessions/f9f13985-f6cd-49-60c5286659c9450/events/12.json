When a user changes their email after requesting a password reset, the old token remains valid because the hash doesn't change. This creates a security vulnerability where someone could use an old password reset link even after the email has been changed.\n\n**1.4 Steps to reproduce:**\n1. User has account with email `foo@...`\n2. User requests password reset for that email (generates token)\n3. User changes their email address to `bar@...`\n4.
