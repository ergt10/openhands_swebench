Here's a summary of what was done:\\n\\n## Problem Identified\\nThe password reset token generator was not including the user's email address in the token hash. This meant that when a user changed their email after requesting a password reset, the old token remained valid, creating a security vulnerability.\\n\\n## Solution Implemented\\nModified the `_make_hash_value()` method in `/workspace/django__django__3.2/django/contrib/auth/tokens.py` to include the user's email address in the token hash:\\n\\n1. Added email retrieval using `user.get_email_field_name()` to support custom user models\\n2. Handled cases where email might be None or empty (for AbstractBaseUser implementations without email)\\n3. Updated the docstring to document that email changes invalidate tokens\\n\\n## Key Changes\\n- **File Modified**: `/workspace/django__django__3.2/django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`\\n- **Method Modified**: `_make_hash_value()`\\n- **Change**: Added `email = getattr(user, user.get_email_field_name(), '') or ''` and included `email` in the hash string\\n\\n## Testing Performed\\n1. Created comprehensive tests to verify the fix works for:\\n   - Normal email changes\\n   - Email from None to value\\n   - Email from value to empty string\\n   - Email case changes\\n   - Multiple email changes\\n   - Custom user models without email fields\\n\\n2. All tests passed, confirming:\\n   - Tokens are invalidated when email changes\\n   - Tokens remain valid when other fields change\\n   - Custom user models without email fields work correctly\\n\\n3. Ran existing Django token tests - all passed without issues\\n\\n## Security Impact\\nThis fix ensures that password reset tokens are immediately invalidated when a user changes their email address, preventing unauthorized access to accounts using old password reset links. The implementation is backward compatible and handles edge cases properly.\\n\"}", "name": "finish"}, "id": "toolu_38", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 413, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 413, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.0, "max_budget_per_task": null, "accumulated_token_usage": {"model": "default", "prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 8041, "cache_read_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "context_window": 0, "per_turn_token": 413, "response_id": ""}, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": []}, "args": {"final_thought": "\nI have successfully implemented the fix for the password reset token security issue.
