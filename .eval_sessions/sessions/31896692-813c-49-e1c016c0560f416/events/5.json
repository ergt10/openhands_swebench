READING: Understanding the Problem\n\nLet me analyze the issue description:\n\n1. **Problem**: When saving a figure with the PostScript backend, a \"TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object\" occurs if the figure contains a multi-line text label with an empty line.\n\n2. **Error details**:\n   - Error occurs in `backend_ps.py` at line 673 in the `draw_text` method\n   - The specific error is: `for ps_name, xs_names in stream: TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object`\n   - This suggests that `stream` is `None` when it should be an iterable\n\n3. **Reproduction code**:\n   ```python\n   from matplotlib.figure import Figure\n   figure = Figure()\n   ax = figure.add_subplot(111)\n   ax.annotate(text='\\nLower label', xy=(0, 0))\n   figure.savefig('figure.eps')\n   ```\n\n4. **Key observations**:\n   - The issue happens with text containing empty lines (like '\\nLower label' or '\\nLower title')\n   - Works fine with other backends (PNG, PDF, SVG, Qt)\n   - Worked in matplotlib <= 3.5.3, broken in 3.6.0\n   - Suggested fix: adding `if curr_stream:` before line 669 of `backend_ps.py`\n\n5. **Steps to reproduce**:\n   - Create a figure with a text annotation containing an empty line\n   - Try to save it as EPS using the PostScript backend\n   - The error occurs during the drawing process\n\n6. **Best practices for fixing**:\n   - Make minimal changes to fix the issue\n   - Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality\n   - Test with various text scenarios (empty lines, normal text, etc.)\n   - Verify the fix works with the PostScript backend specifically\n", "action": "think", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "think", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8b79586d135b41d1851357df1c665bba", "created": 1767714221, "model": "/mnt/shared/models/GLM-4.6-FP8", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "<think></think>\nI'll help you implement the necessary changes to fix the PostScript backend issue with empty lines in text labels.
