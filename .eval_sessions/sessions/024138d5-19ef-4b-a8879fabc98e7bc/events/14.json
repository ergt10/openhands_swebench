I've successfully reproduced the issue. Now let me analyze the problem:\n\n## Phase 1. READING: Understanding the Problem\n\n### 1.1 Code Analysis\nThe test code has a class `SomeClass` with:\n- `__getattribute__` that raises an exception (without specifying which exception)\n- `__repr__` that also raises an exception (without specifying which exception)\n\n### 1.2 Technical Details\n- **Error message**: `RuntimeError: No active exception to reraise`\n- **Key files involved**: `/workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__5.4/src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`\n- **Key methods**: `_format_repr_exception`, `repr_instance`, `_try_repr_or_str`\n- **Stack trace shows**: The error occurs when trying to format an exception raised in `__repr__`, and then that formatting itself fails\n\n### 1.3 Problem Explanation\nWhen pytest tries to display a test failure, it needs to represent the objects involved. If an object's `__repr__` method raises an exception, pytest tries to safely format that exception. However, when the exception formatting itself fails (because the object's `__getattribute__` also raises), the code tries to reraise an exception when there's no active exception to reraise.\n\n### 1.4 Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a class with both `__getattribute__` and `__repr__` that raise exceptions\n2. Create a test that uses an instance of this class\n3. Run pytest on the test\n\n### 1.5 Best Practices\n- The fix should handle nested exceptions gracefully\n- The fix should maintain the safety guarantees of `saferepr`\n- The fix should provide meaningful error information even when both `__repr__` and `__getattribute__` fail\n\n## Phase 2. RUNNING: Environment Setup\nThe environment is already set up and I've successfully reproduced the issue.\n\n## Phase 3.
