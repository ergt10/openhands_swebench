READING: Understanding the Problem\n\n**1.1 Problem Analysis:**\nThe issue is in the `parse_http_date` function in `/workspace/django__django__3.1/django/utils/http.py`. The current logic for handling two-digit years is hardcoded:\n- Years 0-69 are interpreted as 2000-2069\n- Years 70-99 are interpreted as 1970-1999\n\n**1.2 Technical Details:**\n- Method: `parse_http_date` in `django.utils.http`\n- Lines: 178-182\n- Current logic: Hardcoded threshold at 70\n- RFC requirement: Should compare against current year and interpret dates >50 years in the future as the most recent year in the past with same last two digits\n\n**1.3 Problem in Clear Terms:**\nThe current implementation doesn't follow RFC 7231 which states that two-digit years appearing to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits. Instead, it uses a fixed 70/2000 split.\n\n**1.4 Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Parse a date with a two-digit year that would be >50 years in the future\n2. Compare the result with RFC 7231 compliant behavior\n\n**1.5 Best Practices:**\n- Follow RFC specifications exactly\n- Use current year as reference point\n- Maintain backward compatibility where possible\n- Write comprehensive tests\n\n## Phase 2.
