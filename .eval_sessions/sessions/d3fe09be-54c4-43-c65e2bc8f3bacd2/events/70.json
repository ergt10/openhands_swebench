However, currently it causes an infinite recursion because the debug 404 handler tries to resolve the same URL again, which triggers the same Http404 from the converter.\n\n5.2 Problem Location:\nThe issue is in `/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/urls/resolvers.py` at line 260 in the `RoutePattern.match()` method. Currently, it only catches `ValueError` exceptions, but `Http404` exceptions are not caught and propagate up, causing the infinite recursion.\n\n5.3 How the test reproduces the issue:\nThe reproduction script creates a custom converter that raises `Http404` for specific values. When accessing a URL that triggers this converter, the `Http404` is not caught during URL resolution, so it propagates to the exception handler. The exception handler then tries to generate a debug 404 response, which involves resolving the URL again, causing the same `Http404` to be raised again, leading to infinite recursion.\n\n5.4 Best practices to consider:\n- The fix should distinguish between `ValueError` (which means \"this URL doesn't match, try next pattern\") and `Http404` (which means \"this URL matches but the resource doesn't exist\")\n- `Http404` should be caught and re-raised to be handled by the proper exception handling mechanism\n- The fix should be minimal and not break existing functionality\n- Need to ensure that `ValueError` still results in `None` (no match) while `Http404` propagates up\n\n5.5 How to fix the problem:\nModify the `RoutePattern.match()` method in `/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/urls/resolvers.py` to:\n1. Catch `Http404` exceptions specifically and re-raise them\n2. Keep the existing `ValueError` handling that returns `None`\n3.
