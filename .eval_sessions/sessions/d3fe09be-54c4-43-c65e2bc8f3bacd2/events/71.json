However, currently it causes an infinite recursion because the debug 404 handler tries to resolve the same URL again, which triggers the same Http404 from the converter.\\n\\n5.2 Problem Location:\\nThe issue is in `/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/urls/resolvers.py` at line 260 in the `RoutePattern.match()` method. Currently, it only catches `ValueError` exceptions, but `Http404` exceptions are not caught and propagate up, causing the infinite recursion.\\n\\n5.3 How the test reproduces the issue:\\nThe reproduction script creates a custom converter that raises `Http404` for specific values. When accessing a URL that triggers this converter, the `Http404` is not caught during URL resolution, so it propagates to the exception handler. The exception handler then tries to generate a debug 404 response, which involves resolving the URL again, causing the same `Http404` to be raised again, leading to infinite recursion.\\n\\n5.4 Best practices to consider:\\n- The fix should distinguish between `ValueError` (which means \\\"this URL doesn't match, try next pattern\\\") and `Http404` (which means \\\"this URL matches but the resource doesn't exist\\\")\\n- `Http404` should be caught and re-raised to be handled by the proper exception handling mechanism\\n- The fix should be minimal and not break existing functionality\\n- Need to ensure that `ValueError` still results in `None` (no match) while `Http404` propagates up\\n\\n5.5 How to fix the problem:\\nModify the `RoutePattern.match()` method in `/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/urls/resolvers.py` to:\\n1. Catch `Http404` exceptions specifically and re-raise them\\n2. Keep the existing `ValueError` handling that returns `None`\\n3. This will allow `Http404` to be properly handled by the exception handling system while preserving the existing behavior for `ValueError`\\n\\nThe fix should be in the try/except block around line 260 where `converter.to_python(value)` is called.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_33", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 500, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 500, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
