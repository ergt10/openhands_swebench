The issue is that the current merge algorithm creates artificial ordering constraints when merging multiple lists. Let me analyze the solution:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"thought\": \"\\nThe problem is clear now:\\n\\n1. **Step 1**: ['color-picker.js'] + ['text-editor.js'] = ['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']\\n   - This creates an artificial constraint that color-picker.js must come before text-editor.js\\n   - But there's no real dependency between these files\\n\\n2. **Step 2**: ['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'] + ['text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js']\\n   - The merge tries to preserve the artificial constraint from step 1\\n   - This conflicts with the real dependency: text-editor.js should come before text-editor-extras.js\\n\\nThe solution is to change the merge algorithm to be smarter about three-way merges. Instead of just doing sequential two-way merges, we need to consider all the ordering constraints from all lists simultaneously.\\n\\nLooking at the current implementation in `_js` property:\\n```python\\n@property\\ndef _js(self):\\n    js = self._js_lists[0]\\n    for obj in filter(None, self._js_lists[1:]):\\n        js = self.merge(js, obj)\\n    return js\\n```\\n\\nThis does sequential merges. We need to change this to do a multi-way merge that considers all constraints at once.\\n\\nThe fix should:\\n1. Collect all unique files from all lists\\n2. Build a dependency graph based on the relative ordering in each list\\n3. Topologically sort the graph to get the final order\\n4. Only warn about real conflicts (when the same two files appear in different orders in different lists)\\n\\nThis approach will:\\n- Preserve real dependencies (like text-editor.js before text-editor-extras.js)\\n- Not create artificial constraints (like color-picker.js before text-editor.js)\\n- Only warn about actual conflicts\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_21", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 411, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 411, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
