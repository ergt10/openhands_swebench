The problem is with Django's media handling when merging 3 or more media objects\\n2. The issue occurs when widgets have dependencies between their JS files\\n3. In the example, text-editor-extras.js depends on text-editor.js, but the current implementation creates unnecessary warnings\\n4. The warning message seems to report the wrong files as conflicting\\n5. The final order is worse than the \\\"na\\u00efve\\\" result from Django 1.11\\n\\nKey technical details:\\n- Error: MediaOrderConflictWarning in django/forms/widgets.py:145\\n- The issue is in the order that media additions happen\\n- ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media creates an incorrect constraint\\n- The expected order should be: text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js, color-picker.js\\n- But it produces: text-editor-extras.js, color-picker.js, text-editor.js\\n\\nI need to understand how Django's media merging works and fix the logic to properly handle dependencies.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 253, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
