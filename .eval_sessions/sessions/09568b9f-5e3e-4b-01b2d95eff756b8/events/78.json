This happened because the `_combine` method in the Q class used `copy.deepcopy()` which failed when trying to copy non-pickleable objects.\n\n## Solution Implemented\nI added a `_deepcopy_with_fallback` method to the Q class that:\n1. First tries the normal `copy.deepcopy()`\n2. If that fails due to pickle errors, it creates a new Q object with non-pickleable values converted to pickleable forms (lists)\n3. Preserves all existing functionality for pickleable objects\n\n## Changes Made\n1. Added `import pickle` to the imports\n2. Added the `_deepcopy_with_fallback` method to handle the deepcopy with fallback logic\n3. Modified the `_combine` method to use `_deepcopy_with_fallback` instead of direct `copy.deepcopy()`\n\n## Testing\nI thoroughly tested the fix with:\n- The exact case from the issue description\n- Various non-pickleable iterables (dict_keys, dict_values, dict_items, generators, etc.)\n- Pickleable objects to ensure backwards compatibility\n- Complex Q object combinations\n- Mixed scenarios with both pickleable and non-pickleable objects\n\nAll tests passed successfully, confirming the fix works correctly without breaking existing functionality.\n\nThe fix is minimal, focused, and addresses the root cause while maintaining full backwards compatibility.\n", "action": "think", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "think", "tool_call_id": "toolu_37", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-5265b283f2b0421083e4e50902d709b9", "created": 1767712028, "model": "/mnt/shared/models/GLM-4.6-FP8", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "<think></think>\nNow let me provide a final summary of the changes made:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"thought\": \"\\nLet me summarize what I've accomplished:\\n\\n## Problem Analysis\\nThe issue was that using non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys` in Q objects caused the `|` operator to fail with a \\\"TypeError: cannot pickle\\\" error.
