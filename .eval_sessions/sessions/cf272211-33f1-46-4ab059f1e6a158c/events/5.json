Let me start by following the phases systematically.\n\n## Phase 1. READING: Understanding the Problem\n\nLet me analyze the issue description:\n\n1. **Problem**: When pylint receives an unrecognized option (like `-Q`), it prints both a user-friendly error message AND a traceback, which is not user-friendly.\n\n2. **Current behavior**: \n   - Prints: `Command line:1:0: E0015: Unrecognized option found: Q (unrecognized-option)`\n   - Then prints a full traceback ending with `pylint.config.exceptions._UnrecognizedOptionError`\n\n3. **Expected behavior**: \n   - Should only show the user-friendly error message\n   - Should not show the traceback\n   - Should be similar to mypy's clean error output\n\n4. **Technical details from the stack trace**:\n   - Error originates in `pylint/__init__.py` line 24 in `run_pylint`\n   - Goes through `pylint/lint/run.py` line 135 in `__init__`\n   - Finally raised in `pylint/config/config_initialization.py` line 85 as `_UnrecognizedOptionError`\n\n5. **Steps to reproduce**:\n   - Run `pylint -Q` (or any unrecognized option)\n   - Observe both the error message and traceback\n\n6. **Best practices for fixing**:\n   - Catch the `_UnrecognizedOptionError` exception before it propagates to the top level\n   - Handle it gracefully by only showing the user-friendly message\n   - Ensure the exit code is appropriate for error conditions\n   - Don't break existing functionality for valid options\n", "action": "think", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "think", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-fca95f16c352456583c8dd948f77f38c", "created": 1767715429, "model": "/mnt/shared/models/GLM-4.6-FP8", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "<think></think>\nI'll help you implement the necessary changes to fix the traceback issue for unrecognized options in pylint.
