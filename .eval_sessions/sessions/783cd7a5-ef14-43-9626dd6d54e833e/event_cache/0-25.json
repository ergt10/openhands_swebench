The runtime may not support them and can cause unusable shell sessions.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4.

Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

The first example in the documentation demonstrate this:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n>>> import xarray as xr, numpy as np\r\n>>> ds = xr.Dataset(\r\n...     {\"foo\": ((\"x\", \"y\"), np.random.rand(4, 3))},\r\n...     coords={\"x\": [10, 20, 30, 40], \"letters\": (\"x\", list(\"abba\"))},\r\n... )\r\n>>> ds.groupby(\"letters\")\r\nDatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \r\n2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a trailing whitespace in the first line of output which is \"DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \". This can be seen more clearly by converting the object to a string (note the whitespace before `\\n`):\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n>>> str(ds.groupby(\"letters\"))\r\n\"DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \\n2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this isn't a problem in itself, it causes an issue for us because we use flake8 in continuous integration to verify that our code is correctly formatted and we also have doctests that rely on DatasetGroupBy textual representation. Flake8 reports a violation on the trailing whitespaces in our docstrings. If we remove the trailing whitespaces, our doctests fail because the expected output doesn't match the actual output. So we have conflicting constraints coming from our tools which both seem reasonable. Trailing whitespaces are forbidden by flake8 because, among other reasons, they lead to noisy git diffs. Doctest want the expected output to be exactly the same as the actual output and considers a trailing whitespace to be a significant difference. We could configure flake8 to ignore this particular violation for the files in which we have these doctests, but this may cause other trailing whitespaces to creep in our code, which we don't want. Unfortunately it's not possible to just add `# NoQA` comments to get flake8 to ignore the violation only for specific lines because that creates a difference between expected and actual output from doctest point of view. Flake8 doesn't allow to disable checks for blocks of code either.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason for having this trailing whitespace in DatasetGroupBy representation? Whould it be OK to remove it?

N-dimensional, ND) arrays (sometimes called\n    45\t\"tensors\") are an essential part of computational science.\n    46\tThey are encountered in a wide range of fields, including physics, astronomy,\n    47\tgeoscience, bioinformatics, engineering, finance, and deep learning.\n    48\tIn Python, NumPy_ provides the fundamental data structure and API for\n    49\tworking with raw ND arrays.\n    50\tHowever, real-world datasets are usually more than just raw numbers;\n    51\tthey have labels which encode information about how the array values map\n    52\tto locations in space, time, etc.\n    53\t\n    54\tXarray doesn't just keep track of labels on arrays -- it uses them to provide a\n    55\tpowerful and concise interface. For example:\n    56\t\n    57\t-  Apply operations over dimensions by name: ``x.sum('time')``.\n    58\t-  Select values by label instead of integer location:\n    59\t   ``x.loc['2014-01-01']`` or ``x.sel(time='2014-01-01')``.\n    60\t-  Mathematical operations (e.g., ``x - y``) vectorize across multiple\n    61\t   dimensions (array broadcasting) based on dimension names, not shape.\n    62\t-  Flexible split-apply-combine operations with groupby:\n    63\t   ``x.groupby('time.dayofyear').mean()``.\n    64\t-  Database like alignment based on coordinate labels that smoothly\n    65\t   handles missing values: ``x, y = xr.align(x, y, join='outer')``.\n    66\t-  Keep track of arbitrary metadata in the form of a Python dictionary:\n    67\t   ``x.attrs``.\n    68\t\n    69\tDocumentation\n    70\t-------------\n    71\t\n    72\tLearn more about xarray in its official documentation at https://xarray.pydata.org/\n    73\t\n    74\tContributing\n    75\t------------\n    76\t\n    77\tYou can find information about contributing to xarray at our `Contributing page <https://xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/contributing.html#>`_.\n    78\t\n    79\tGet in touch\n    80\t------------\n    81\t\n    82\t- Ask usage questions (\"How do I?\") on `StackOverflow`_.\n    83\t- Report bugs, suggest features or view the source code `on GitHub`_.\n    84\t- For less well defined questions or ideas, or to announce other projects of\n    85\t  interest to xarray users, use the `mailing list`_.\n    86\t\n    87\t.. _StackOverFlow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-xarray\n    88\t.. _mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/xarray\n    89\t.. _on GitHub: https://github.com/pydata/xarray\n    90\t\n    91\tNumFOCUS\n    92\t--------\n    93\t\n    94\t.. image:: https://numfocus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NumFocus_LRG.png\n    95\t   :scale: 25 %\n    96\t   :target: https://numfocus.org/\n    97\t\n    98\tXarray is a fiscally sponsored project of NumFOCUS_, a nonprofit dedicated\n    99\tto supporting the open source scientific computing community.
