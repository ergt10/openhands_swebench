N-dimensional, ND) arrays (sometimes called\n    45\t\"tensors\") are an essential part of computational science.\n    46\tThey are encountered in a wide range of fields, including physics, astronomy,\n    47\tgeoscience, bioinformatics, engineering, finance, and deep learning.\n    48\tIn Python, NumPy_ provides the fundamental data structure and API for\n    49\tworking with raw ND arrays.\n    50\tHowever, real-world datasets are usually more than just raw numbers;\n    51\tthey have labels which encode information about how the array values map\n    52\tto locations in space, time, etc.\n    53\t\n    54\tXarray doesn't just keep track of labels on arrays -- it uses them to provide a\n    55\tpowerful and concise interface. For example:\n    56\t\n    57\t-  Apply operations over dimensions by name: ``x.sum('time')``.\n    58\t-  Select values by label instead of integer location:\n    59\t   ``x.loc['2014-01-01']`` or ``x.sel(time='2014-01-01')``.\n    60\t-  Mathematical operations (e.g., ``x - y``) vectorize across multiple\n    61\t   dimensions (array broadcasting) based on dimension names, not shape.\n    62\t-  Flexible split-apply-combine operations with groupby:\n    63\t   ``x.groupby('time.dayofyear').mean()``.\n    64\t-  Database like alignment based on coordinate labels that smoothly\n    65\t   handles missing values: ``x, y = xr.align(x, y, join='outer')``.\n    66\t-  Keep track of arbitrary metadata in the form of a Python dictionary:\n    67\t   ``x.attrs``.\n    68\t\n    69\tDocumentation\n    70\t-------------\n    71\t\n    72\tLearn more about xarray in its official documentation at https://xarray.pydata.org/\n    73\t\n    74\tContributing\n    75\t------------\n    76\t\n    77\tYou can find information about contributing to xarray at our `Contributing page <https://xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/contributing.html#>`_.\n    78\t\n    79\tGet in touch\n    80\t------------\n    81\t\n    82\t- Ask usage questions (\"How do I?\") on `StackOverflow`_.\n    83\t- Report bugs, suggest features or view the source code `on GitHub`_.\n    84\t- For less well defined questions or ideas, or to announce other projects of\n    85\t  interest to xarray users, use the `mailing list`_.\n    86\t\n    87\t.. _StackOverFlow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-xarray\n    88\t.. _mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/xarray\n    89\t.. _on GitHub: https://github.com/pydata/xarray\n    90\t\n    91\tNumFOCUS\n    92\t--------\n    93\t\n    94\t.. image:: https://numfocus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NumFocus_LRG.png\n    95\t   :scale: 25 %\n    96\t   :target: https://numfocus.org/\n    97\t\n    98\tXarray is a fiscally sponsored project of NumFOCUS_, a nonprofit dedicated\n    99\tto supporting the open source scientific computing community.
