Looking at the `TypeSerializer` class in `serializer.py`, I can see the problem:\\n\\n1. In lines 275-281, there are special cases for `models.Model` and `type(None)`\\n2. For `models.Model`, it returns the string `\\\"models.Model\\\"` with an empty imports set `[]`\\n3. This means when `models.Model` is serialized, it returns the string `\\\"models.Model\\\"` but doesn't include the import for `models`\\n\\nThe issue is that the `TypeSerializer` handles `models.Model` as a special case but doesn't add the necessary import. When this gets used in the bases tuple, the migration writer sees the string `\\\"models.Model\\\"` but doesn't know it needs to import `models`.\\n\\nThe fix should be to change the imports for the `models.Model` special case from `[]` to `{\\\"from django.db import models\\\"}`.\\n\\nLet me verify this by looking at how the migration writer processes imports.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_30", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 224, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 224, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
