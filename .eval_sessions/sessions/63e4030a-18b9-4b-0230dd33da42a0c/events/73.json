The issue occurs when permissions already exist with the proxy content type (perhaps from a previous migration or manual creation)\\n3. When the migration tries to update permissions from concrete to proxy content type, it creates duplicates because the target permissions already exist\\n\\nThe problem is in the migration logic - it only looks for permissions with the concrete content type and tries to update them to the proxy content type, but it doesn't check if permissions with the proxy content type already exist.\\n\\nThe fix should be to make the migration idempotent by:\\n1. First checking if permissions with the proxy content type already exist\\n2. If they do, either skip the update or handle the duplicates gracefully\\n3.
