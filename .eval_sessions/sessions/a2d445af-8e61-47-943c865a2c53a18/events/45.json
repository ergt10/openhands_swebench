Now I've successfully reproduced the issue. The error occurs exactly as described:\n\n```\nTypeError: 'method' object is not subscriptable\n```\n\nThis happens in the `_tick_only` function at line 16 when trying to access `ax.axis[\"bottom\"]`.

The `_tick_only` function assumes that `ax.axis` is subscriptable (like a dictionary)\\n2. For `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.mpl_axes.Axes`, the `axis` property returns an `AxisDict` object which is subscriptable\\n3. For other axes classes (like `GeoAxes` or our `CustomAxes`), `axis` is just a method, not subscriptable\\n\\nThe fix needs to:\\n1. Check if `ax.axis` is subscriptable before trying to use it as such\\n2. If it's not subscriptable, we need to use an alternative approach to control tick labels\\n3. For regular matplotlib axes, we can use methods like `tick_params` to control tick visibility\\n\\nLet me look at what methods are available on standard matplotlib axes to control tick labels, and then implement a robust solution.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_20", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 269, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 269, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
