If you're not familiar with\n    27\thow to do that, read our :doc:`contributing tutorial </intro/contributing>`.\n    28\t\n    29\tNext, clone your fork, install some requirements, and run the tests::\n    30\t\n    31\t   $ git clone git@github.com:YourGitHubName/django.git django-repo\n    32\t   $ cd django-repo/tests\n    33\t   $ pip install -e ..\n    34\t   $ pip install -r requirements/py3.txt\n    35\t   $ ./runtests.py\n    36\t\n    37\tInstalling the requirements will likely require some operating system packages\n    38\tthat your computer doesn't have installed. You can usually figure out which\n    39\tpackage to install by doing a Web search for the last line or so of the error\n    40\tmessage. Try adding your operating system to the search query if needed.\n    41\t\n    42\tIf you have trouble installing the requirements, you can skip that step. See\n    43\t:ref:`running-unit-tests-dependencies` for details on installing the optional\n    44\ttest dependencies. If you don't have an optional dependency installed, the\n    45\ttests that require it will be skipped.\n    46\t\n    47\tRunning the tests requires a Django settings module that defines the databases\n    48\tto use. To make it easy to get started, Django provides and uses a sample\n    49\tsettings module that uses the SQLite database. See\n    50\t:ref:`running-unit-tests-settings` to learn how to use a different settings\n    51\tmodule to run the tests with a different database.\n    52\t\n    53\t.. admonition:: Windows users\n    54\t\n    55\t    We recommend something like `Git Bash <https://msysgit.github.io/>`_ to run\n    56\t    the tests using the above approach.\n    57\t\n    58\tHaving problems? See :ref:`troubleshooting-unit-tests` for some common issues.\n    59\t\n    60\tRunning tests using ``tox``\n    61\t---------------------------\n    62\t\n    63\t`Tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/>`_ is a tool for running tests in different\n    64\tvirtual environments. Django includes a basic ``tox.ini`` that automates some\n    65\tchecks that our build server performs on pull requests. To run the unit tests\n    66\tand other checks (such as :ref:`import sorting <coding-style-imports>`, the\n    67\t:ref:`documentation spelling checker <documentation-spelling-check>`, and\n    68\t:ref:`code formatting <coding-style-python>`), install and run the ``tox``\n    69\tcommand from any place in the Django source tree::\n    70\t\n    71\t    $ pip install tox\n    72\t    $ tox\n    73\t\n    74\tBy default, ``tox`` runs the test suite with the bundled test settings file for\n    75\tSQLite, ``flake8``, ``isort``, and the documentation spelling checker. In\n    76\taddition to the system dependencies noted elsewhere in this documentation,\n    77\tthe command ``python3`` must be on your path and linked to the appropriate\n    78\tversion of Python. A list of default environments can be seen as follows::\n    79\t\n    80\t    $ tox -l\n    81\t    py3\n    82\t    flake8\n    83\t    docs\n    84\t    isort\n    85\t\n    86\tTesting other Python versions and database backends\n    87\t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    88\t\n    89\tIn addition to the default environments, ``tox`` supports running unit tests\n    90\tfor other versions of Python and other database backends. Since Django's test\n    91\tsuite doesn't bundle a settings file for database backends other than SQLite,\n    92\thowever, you must :ref:`create and provide your own test settings\n    93\t<running-unit-tests-settings>`. For example, to run the tests on Python 3.7\n    94\tusing PostgreSQL::\n    95\t\n    96\t    $ tox -e py37-postgres -- --settings=my_postgres_settings\n    97\t\n    98\tThis command sets up a Python 3.7 virtual environment, installs Django's\n    99\ttest suite dependencies (including those for PostgreSQL), and calls\n   100\t``runtests.py`` with the supplied arguments (in this case,\n   101\t``--settings=my_postgres_settings``).\n   102\t\n   103\tThe remainder of this documentation shows commands for running tests without\n   104\t``tox``, however, any option passed to ``runtests.py`` can also be passed to\n   105\t``tox`` by prefixing the argument list with ``--``, as above.\n   106\t\n   107\tTox also respects the ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` environment variable, if set.\n   108\tFor example, the following is equivalent to the command above::\n   109\t\n   110\t    $ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=my_postgres_settings tox -e py35-postgres\n   111\t\n   112\tRunning the JavaScript tests\n   113\t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n   114\t\n   115\tDjango includes a set of :ref:`JavaScript unit tests <javascript-tests>` for\n   116\tfunctions in certain contrib apps. The JavaScript tests aren't run by default\n   117\tusing ``tox`` because they require `Node.js` to be installed and aren't\n   118\tnecessary for the majority of patches. To run the JavaScript tests using\n   119\t``tox``::\n   120\t\n   121\t    $ tox -e javascript\n   122\t\n   123\tThis command runs ``npm install`` to ensure test requirements are up to\n   124\tdate and then runs ``npm test``.\n   125\t\n   126\t.. _running-unit-tests-settings:\n   127\t\n   128\tUsing another ``settings`` module\n   129\t---------------------------------\n   130\t\n   131\tThe included settings module (``tests/test_sqlite.py``) allows you to run the\n   132\ttest suite using SQLite. If you want to run the tests using a different\n   133\tdatabase, you'll need to define your own settings file. Some tests, such as\n   134\tthose for ``contrib.postgres``, are specific to a particular database backend\n   135\tand will be skipped if run with a different backend.\n   136\t\n   137\tTo run the tests with different settings, ensure that the module is on your\n   138\t``PYTHONPATH`` and pass the module with ``--settings``.\n   139\t\n   140\tThe :setting:`DATABASES` setting in any test settings module needs to define\n   141\ttwo databases:\n   142\t\n   143\t* A ``default`` database. This database should use the backend that\n   144\t  you want to use for primary testing.\n   145\t\n   146\t* A database with the alias ``other``. The ``other`` database is used to test\n   147\t  that queries can be directed to different databases. This database should use\n   148\t  the same backend as the ``default``, and it must have a different name.\n   149\t\n   150\tIf you're using a backend that isn't SQLite, you will need to provide other\n   151\tdetails for each database:\n   152\t\n   153\t* The :setting:`USER` option needs to specify an existing user account\n   154\t  for the database. That user needs permission to execute ``CREATE DATABASE``\n   155\t  so that the test database can be created.\n   156\t\n   157\t* The :setting:`PASSWORD` option needs to provide the password for\n   158\t  the :setting:`USER` that has been specified.\n   159\t\n   160\tTest databases get their names by prepending ``test_`` to the value of the\n   161\t:setting:`NAME` settings for the databases defined in :setting:`DATABASES`.\n   162\tThese test databases are deleted when the tests are finished.\n   163\t\n   164\tYou will also need to ensure that your database uses UTF-8 as the default\n   165\tcharacter set. If your database server doesn't use UTF-8 as a default charset,\n   166\tyou will need to include a value for :setting:`CHARSET <TEST_CHARSET>` in the\n   167\ttest settings dictionary for the applicable database.\n   168\t\n   169\t.. _runtests-specifying-labels:\n   170\t\n   171\tRunning only some of the tests\n   172\t------------------------------\n   173\t\n   174\tDjango's entire test suite takes a while to run, and running every single test\n   175\tcould be redundant if, say, you just added a test to Django that you want to\n   176\trun quickly without running everything else. You can run a subset of the unit\n   177\ttests by appending the names of the test modules to ``runtests.py`` on the\n   178\tcommand line.\n   179\t\n   180\tFor example, if you'd like to run tests only for generic relations and\n   181\tinternationalization, type::\n   182\t\n   183\t   $ ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings generic_relations i18n\n   184\t\n   185\tHow do you find out the names of individual tests? Look in ``tests/`` \u2014 each\n   186\tdirectory name there is the name of a test.\n   187\t\n   188\tIf you just want to run a particular class of tests, you can specify a list of\n   189\tpaths to individual test classes. For example, to run the ``TranslationTests``\n   190\tof the ``i18n`` module, type::\n   191\t\n   192\t   $ ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings i18n.tests.TranslationTests\n   193\t\n   194\tGoing beyond that, you can specify an individual test method like this::\n   195\t\n   196\t   $ ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings i18n.tests.TranslationTests.test_lazy_objects\n   197\t\n   198\tRunning the Selenium tests\n   199\t--------------------------\n   200\t\n   201\tSome tests require Selenium and a Web browser. To run these tests, you must\n   202\tinstall the selenium_ package and run the tests with the\n   203\t``--selenium=<BROWSERS>`` option. For example, if you have Firefox and Google\n   204\tChrome installed::\n   205\t\n   206\t   $ ./runtests.py --selenium=firefox,chrome\n   207\t\n   208\tSee the `selenium.webdriver`_ package for the list of available browsers.\n   209\t\n   210\tSpecifying ``--selenium`` automatically sets ``--tags=selenium`` to run only\n   211\tthe tests that require selenium.\n   212\t\n   213\t.. _selenium.webdriver: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/master/py/selenium/webdriver\n   214\t\n   215\t.. _running-unit-tests-dependencies:\n   216\t\n   217\tRunning all the tests\n   218\t---------------------\n   219\t\n   220\tIf you want to run the full suite of tests, you'll need to install a number of\n   221\tdependencies:\n   222\t\n   223\t*  argon2-cffi_ 16.1.0+\n   224\t*  bcrypt_\n   225\t*  docutils_\n   226\t*  geoip2_\n   227\t*  jinja2_ 2.7+\n   228\t*  numpy_\n   229\t*  Pillow_\n   230\t*  PyYAML_\n   231\t*  pytz_ (required)\n   232\t*  pywatchman_\n   233\t*  setuptools_\n   234\t*  memcached_, plus a :ref:`supported Python binding <memcached>`\n   235\t*  gettext_ (:ref:`gettext_on_windows`)\n   236\t*  selenium_\n   237\t*  sqlparse_ (required)\n   238\t\n   239\tYou can find these dependencies in `pip requirements files`_ inside the\n   240\t``tests/requirements`` directory of the Django source tree and install them\n   241\tlike so::\n   242\t\n   243\t   $ pip install -r tests/requirements/py3.txt\n   244\t\n   245\tIf you encounter an error during the installation, your system might be missing\n   246\ta dependency for one or more of the Python packages.

Optionally, add those export\n   335\tcommands to your shell's startup file (e.g. ``~/.bashrc`` for Bash) to avoid\n   336\thaving to retype them.\n   337\t\n   338\tTests that only fail in combination\n   339\t-----------------------------------\n   340\t\n   341\tIn case a test passes when run in isolation but fails within the whole suite,\n   342\twe have some tools to help analyze the problem.\n   343\t\n   344\tThe ``--bisect`` option of ``runtests.py`` will run the failing test while\n   345\thalving the test set it is run together with on each iteration, often making\n   346\tit possible to identify a small number of tests that may be related to the\n   347\tfailure.\n   348\t\n   349\tFor example, suppose that the failing test that works on its own is\n   350\t``ModelTest.test_eq``, then using::\n   351\t\n   352\t    $ ./runtests.py --bisect basic.tests.ModelTest.test_eq\n   353\t\n   354\twill try to determine a test that interferes with the given one. First, the\n   355\ttest is run with the first half of the test suite. If a failure occurs, the\n   356\tfirst half of the test suite is split in two groups and each group is then run\n   357\twith the specified test. If there is no failure with the first half of the test\n   358\tsuite, the second half of the test suite is run with the specified test and\n   359\tsplit appropriately as described earlier. The process repeats until the set of\n   360\tfailing tests is minimized.\n   361\t\n   362\tThe ``--pair`` option runs the given test alongside every other test from the\n   363\tsuite, letting you check if another test has side-effects that cause the\n   364\tfailure.
