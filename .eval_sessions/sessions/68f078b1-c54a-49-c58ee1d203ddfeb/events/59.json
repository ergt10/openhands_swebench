It clearly shows 0o600 vs 0o644.\\n\\n5.4 Best practices for the fix:\\n- The fix should be minimal and focused\\n- Should maintain backward compatibility where possible\\n- Should follow the principle of least surprise - same behavior regardless of file size\\n- Should use a reasonable default permission that works for web applications\\n- 0o644 is a good default as it allows web servers to read uploaded files while maintaining security\\n\\n5.5 How to fix the problem:\\nChange the default value of FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS from None to 0o644 in global_settings.py. This ensures consistent behavior regardless of whether TemporaryUploadedFile or InMemoryUploadedFile is used.\\n\\nThe fix is simple: change line 307 in django/conf/global_settings.py from:\\n```python\\nFILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None\\n```\\nto:\\n```python\\nFILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644\\n```\\n\\nThis ensures that FileSystemStorage._save() will always apply 0o644 permissions via os.chmod() on line 284, regardless of the initial file permissions.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_27", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 479, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 479, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
