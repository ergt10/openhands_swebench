The problem is with Django's RenameModel migration operation\\n2. When a model already has `db_table` defined, the RenameModel operation should be a no-op (no operation)\\n3. Currently, in PostgreSQL it drops and recreates foreign key constraints unnecessarily\\n4. In SQLite it recreates the table (which is expected for table renaming, but shouldn't happen if db_table is already set)\\n\\nThe core issue is that RenameModel should check if the model already has a custom db_table name, and if so, it should not perform any database operations since the table name is already explicitly set.\\n\\nLet me start by exploring the codebase to understand how RenameModel works.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 188, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
