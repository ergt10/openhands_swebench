This causes:\\n1. In PostgreSQL: drops and recreates foreign key constraints unnecessarily\\n2. In SQLite: recreates the table (which is expected for table renaming, but shouldn't happen if db_table is already set)\\n\\nThe fix should be to check if both the old and new models have the same `db_table` value, and if so, skip the database operations entirely.\\n\\nLet me first create a test to reproduce this issue.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_15", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 197, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 197, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
