Let me summarize:\n\n## Phase 1. READING: Understanding the Problem\n\n### 1.1-1.3 Problem Explanation\nThe issue is in the `delete()` method of the `Collector` class in `/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/db/models/deletion.py`. When deleting a model instance that has no dependencies (no related objects to delete), the code takes an optimized fast path at lines 274-280. However, this fast path doesn't clear the primary key (PK) of the deleted instance, while the normal deletion path (lines 319-327) does clear the PK.\n\n### 1.4 Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a model instance with no foreign key relationships pointing to it\n2. Call `.delete()` on the instance\n3. Check the instance's PK - it will still have its original value instead of being set to None\n\n### 1.5 Best Practices\n- The PK should be set to None after deletion to indicate the object no longer exists in the database\n- The fix should be minimal and consistent with the existing code pattern\n\n## Phase 2.
