I've successfully reproduced the issue. The test shows:\n\n1. **Regex Behavior**: The regex `r'(.*)\\s(ASC|DESC)(.*)'` only captures the last line when dealing with multiline SQL\n2. **Django Behavior**: Only 2 out of 3 order_by clauses are present - the third one is incorrectly removed as a duplicate\n\n## Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: Understanding the Problem and Solution\n\n**5.1 Problem Statement:**\nThe `ordering_parts` regex in `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()` only captures the last line of multiline SQL expressions, causing different RawSQL expressions to appear as duplicates when their last lines are identical.\n\n**5.2 Problem Location:**\n- File: `/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`\n- Lines: 356 and 369 where `self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)` is called\n- Regex definition: Line 35: `self.ordering_parts = re.compile(r'(.*)\\s(ASC|DESC)(.*)')`\n\n**5.3 How the Test Reproduces the Issue:**\nThe test creates 3 multiline RawSQL order_by clauses where the last two have identical last lines (`else null end`). The regex extracts only these last lines, making them appear as duplicates.\n\n**5.4 Best Practices for the Fix:**\n- Handle multiline SQL properly by normalizing whitespace\n- Ensure the fix doesn't break existing single-line SQL\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Use a simple, robust solution\n\n**5.5 Solution:**\nNormalize the SQL by replacing newlines with spaces before applying the regex, as suggested in the issue description.\n\n## Phase 6.
