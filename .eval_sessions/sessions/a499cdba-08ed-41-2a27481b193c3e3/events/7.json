In Django 3.2, an `identity` property was added to all `ForeignObjectRel` classes to enable comparison\\n2. This identity is used to create a hash, and it must be hashable\\n3. For `limit_choices_to` (one element of the identity tuple), there's a `make_hashable` call\\n4. However, `through_fields` can be a list, and the `make_hashable` call is missing in `ManyToManyRel`\\n5. This causes a `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` when trying to hash the identity\\n6. The issue specifically occurs with proxy models during model checking\\n\\nThe solution is to add the missing `make_hashable` call on `self.through_fields` in `ManyToManyRel`.\\n\\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure to understand how it's organized and find the relevant files.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 255, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 255, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
