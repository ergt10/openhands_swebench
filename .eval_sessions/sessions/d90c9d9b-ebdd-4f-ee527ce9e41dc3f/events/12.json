READING: Understanding the Problem\n\n1.1 **Best practices/conventions**: The issue mentions that Django logs exceptions in other similar situations (like missing template variables), and that expected exceptions should be caught in the receiver function itself.\n\n1.2 **Technical details**:\n- Method name: `Signal.send_robust()`\n- File location: `/workspace/django__django__3.2/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`\n- Current behavior: Exceptions in receivers are caught and returned as error instances (line 210-211)\n- Desired behavior: Add `logger.exception()` call in the except clause\n\n1.3 **Problem explanation**: \nThe `send_robust()` method catches exceptions from signal receivers but doesn't log them. This makes debugging difficult when receivers fail silently. The issue requests adding logging so that error handling tools like Sentry can capture these exceptions.\n\n1.4 **Steps to reproduce**:\n1. Create a signal\n2. Connect a receiver that raises an exception\n3. Call `send_robust()` on the signal\n4. Observe that the exception is not logged (though it's returned in the response)\n\n1.5 **Best practices for testing/fixing**:\n- Import logging module\n- Use `logger.exception()` which automatically captures stack trace\n- Ensure the logger is properly configured\n- Test that exceptions are both logged and returned\n\nLet me check if there's already a logger in this file:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"grep -n \\\"import logging\\\" /workspace/django__django__3.2/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\", \"security_risk\": \"LOW\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "toolu_04", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 375, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.0, "max_budget_per_task": null, "accumulated_token_usage": {"model": "default", "prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 600, "cache_read_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "context_window": 0, "per_turn_token": 375, "response_id": ""}, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": []}, "args": {"command": "grep -n \"import logging\" /workspace/django__django__3.2/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py", "is_input": false, "thought": "<think></think>\nNow let me understand the problem better by looking at the issue description and the code:\n\n### Phase 1.
