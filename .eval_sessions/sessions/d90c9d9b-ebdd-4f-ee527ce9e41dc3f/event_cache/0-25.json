The runtime may not support them and can cause unusable shell sessions.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2.

EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

"Here's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/django__django__3.2/django/template/base.py:\n     1\t\"\"\"\n     2\tThis is the Django template system.\n     3\t\n     4\tHow it works:\n     5\t\n     6\tThe Lexer.tokenize() method converts a template string (i.e., a string\n     7\tcontaining markup with custom template tags) to tokens, which can be either\n     8\tplain text (TokenType.TEXT), variables (TokenType.VAR), or block statements\n     9\t(TokenType.BLOCK).\n    10\t\n    11\tThe Parser() class takes a list of tokens in its constructor, and its parse()\n    12\tmethod returns a compiled template -- which is, under the hood, a list of\n    13\tNode objects.\n    14\t\n    15\tEach Node is responsible for creating some sort of output -- e.g. simple text\n    16\t(TextNode), variable values in a given context (VariableNode), results of basic\n    17\tlogic (IfNode), results of looping (ForNode), or anything else. The core Node\n    18\ttypes are TextNode, VariableNode, IfNode and ForNode, but plugin modules can\n    19\tdefine their own custom node types.\n    20\t\n    21\tEach Node has a render() method, which takes a Context and returns a string of\n    22\tthe rendered node. For example, the render() method of a Variable Node returns\n    23\tthe variable's value as a string. The render() method of a ForNode returns the\n    24\trendered output of whatever was inside the loop, recursively.\n    25\t\n    26\tThe Template class is a convenient wrapper that takes care of template\n    27\tcompilation and rendering.\n    28\t\n    29\tUsage:\n    30\t\n    31\tThe only thing you should ever use directly in this file is the Template class.\n    32\tCreate a compiled template object with a template_string, then call render()\n    33\twith a context. In the compilation stage, the TemplateSyntaxError exception\n    34\twill be raised if the template doesn't have proper syntax.\n    35\t\n    36\tSample code:\n    37\t\n    38\t>>> from django import template\n    39\t>>> s = '<html>{% if test %}<h1>{{ varvalue }}</h1>{% endif %}</html>'\n    40\t>>> t = template.Template(s)\n    41\t\n    42\t(t is now a compiled template, and its render() method can be called multiple\n    43\ttimes with multiple contexts)\n    44\t\n    45\t>>> c = template.Context({'test':True, 'varvalue': 'Hello'})\n    46\t>>> t.render(c)\n    47\t'<html><h1>Hello</h1></html>'\n    48\t>>> c = template.Context({'test':False, 'varvalue': 'Hello'})\n    49\t>>> t.render(c)\n    50\t'<html></html>'\n", "extras": {"path":
