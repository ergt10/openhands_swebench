Let me analyze what's happening:\n\n## Phase 1. READING: Problem Analysis\n\nThe issue is that when `--recursive=y` is used, the `ignore-paths` configuration is being ignored. Looking at the code:\n\n1. In `_discover_files()` (line 585), the ignore-paths check is applied to directories during the walk\n2. However, individual files within those directories are not being checked against ignore-paths\n3. The `_is_ignored_file()` function correctly checks ignore-paths, but it's only applied to directory roots, not individual files\n\n## Phase 2.
