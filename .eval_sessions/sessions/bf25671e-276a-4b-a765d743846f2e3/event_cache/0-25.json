The runtime may not support them and can cause unusable shell sessions.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4.

Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

The code follows standard matplotlib practices:\n- Creates a figure and axes using `plt.subplots()`\n- Uses `BoundaryNorm` with linearly spaced boundaries\n- Creates a random data array and displays it with `imshow()`\n- Applies a colormap and the BoundaryNorm\n\n**1.2 Technical Details:**\n- **Error location**: `/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/artist.py`, line 1282, in `format_cursor_data`\n- **Error message**: `ValueError: BoundaryNorm is not invertible`\n- **Method chain**: `format_cursor_data` \u2192 `self.norm.inverse()` \u2192 raises ValueError\n- **File involved**: `/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/colors.py`, line 1829, in `inverse` method\n\n**1.3 Problem Explanation:**\nWhen a user hovers their mouse over an image that uses BoundaryNorm normalization, matplotlib's `format_cursor_data` method tries to call the `inverse()` method on the BoundaryNorm to display cursor data. However, BoundaryNorm explicitly raises a `ValueError` stating it's not invertible, causing the application to crash and stop responding to mouse interactions.\n\n**1.4 Reproduction Steps:**\n1. Import matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and matplotlib\n2. Create a figure and axes\n3. Create a BoundaryNorm with linearly spaced boundaries\n4. Generate random data and display it with imshow() using the BoundaryNorm\n5. Move the mouse over the displayed image\n6. The application crashes with a ValueError\n\n**1.5 Best Practices for Fix:**\n- The fix should be minimal and focused\n- Should handle the non-invertible case gracefully\n- Should not break existing functionality\n- Should maintain backward compatibility\n- Should follow matplotlib's error handling patterns", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"plan\", \"task_list\": [{\"description\": \"Phase 1: READING - Understand the problem and reword it clearly\", \"status\": \"done\"}, {\"description\": \"Phase 2: RUNNING - Set up environment and run tests\", \"status\": \"in_progress\"}, {\"description\": \"Phase 3: EXPLORATION - Find relevant files and methods\", \"status\": \"todo\"}, {\"description\": \"Phase 4: TEST CREATION - Create reproduction script\", \"status\": \"todo\"}, {\"description\": \"Phase 5: FIX ANALYSIS - Analyze the problem and solution\", \"status\": \"todo\"}, {\"description\": \"Phase 6: FIX IMPLEMENTATION - Implement the fix\", \"status\": \"todo\"}, {\"description\": \"Phase 7: VERIFICATION - Test the implementation\", \"status\": \"todo\"}, {\"description\": \"Phase 8: FINAL REVIEW - Ensure all requirements are met\", \"status\": \"todo\"}]}", "name": "task_tracker"}, "id": "toolu_03", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 618, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 618, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.0, "max_budget_per_task": null, "accumulated_token_usage": {"model": "default", "prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 1090, "cache_read_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "context_window": 0, "per_turn_token": 618, "response_id": ""}, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": []}, "args": {"command": "plan", "task_list": [{"id": "task-1", "title": "Untitled task", "status": "done", "notes": ""}, {"id": "task-2", "title": "Untitled task", "status": "in_progress", "notes": ""}, {"id": "task-3", "title": "Untitled task", "status": "todo", "notes": ""}, {"id": "task-4", "title": "Untitled task", "status": "todo", "notes": ""}, {"id": "task-5", "title": "Untitled task", "status": "todo", "notes": ""}, {"id": "task-6", "title": "Untitled task", "status": "todo", "notes": ""}, {"id": "task-7", "title": "Untitled task", "status": "todo", "notes": ""}, {"id": "task-8", "title": "Untitled task", "status": "todo", "notes": ""}], "thought": ""}}, {"id": 11, "timestamp": "2026-01-06T15:40:23.887836", "source": "agent", "message": "Task list has been updated with 8 items.
