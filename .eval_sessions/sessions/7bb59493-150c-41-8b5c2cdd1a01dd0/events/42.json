Looking at line 1451: `diag_vars.append(x_var)`, where `x_var` should be the full tuple but somehow becomes just `'1'`.\\n\\n4. **The fix**: I need to ensure that when working with MultiIndex columns, the full tuple is always used as the key, not just parts of it. The issue might be in how the variables are being compared or processed in the diagonal mapping logic.\\n\\nLet me investigate further to see exactly where the tuple is getting broken down.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_18", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 333, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 333, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
