The old axes object that was grabbing the mouse still holds the grab even after `clf()`, which blocks all mouse input to the newly created widgets.\\n\\n**Where the problem is located:**\\nThe issue is in the RangeSlider's `_update` method in `/workspace/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.7/lib/matplotlib/widgets.py` around lines 872-883. When a button press occurs, the slider grabs the mouse with `event.canvas.grab_mouse(self.ax)`. When the button is released, it should release the mouse, but if the callback clears the figure before the release happens, the grab is never released.\\n\\n**How the test reproduces the issue:**\\nMy test demonstrates that:\\n1. When a slider grabs the mouse, `fig.canvas.mouse_grabber` points to the slider's axes\\n2. After `clf()` is called, the grabber still points to the old axes object\\n3. This blocks mouse input to new widgets\\n\\n**Best practices for the fix:**\\n1. The fix should be minimal and focused\\n2. It should ensure mouse grab is always properly released\\n3. It should not break existing functionality\\n4. It should be consistent with how other widgets handle this\\n\\n**How to fix the problem:**\\nThe solution is to ensure that when a RangeSlider's callback is triggered (which happens on button release), the mouse grab is properly released before the callback executes. This can be done by modifying the `_update` method to release the mouse grab before processing the \\\"changed\\\" event.\\n\\nLooking at the code, the issue is in the `_update` method where the callback is triggered at line 969: `self._observers.process(\\\"changed\\\", (vmin, vmax))`. The mouse should be released before this line if we're in a button release event.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_48", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 442, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 442, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
