Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\n[Bug]: using clf and pyplot.draw in range slider on_changed callback blocks input to widgets\n### Bug summary\n\nWhen using clear figure, adding new widgets and then redrawing the current figure in the on_changed callback of a range slider the inputs to all the widgets in the figure are blocked. When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.7 directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 7eafdd8af3c523c1c77b027d378fb337dd489f18.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.", "thought": ""}}
