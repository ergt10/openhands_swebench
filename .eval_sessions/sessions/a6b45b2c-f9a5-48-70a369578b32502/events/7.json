The problem is that when a model has a UniqueConstraint, Django's makemigrations doesn't validate that the fields specified in the constraint actually exist on the model.\\n\\n2. This is inconsistent with the older unique_together syntax, which properly raises models.E012 error when fields don't exist.\\n\\n3.
