The issue is that `exec()` is called without providing a globals dictionary, so variables defined in the outer scope (like `import django`) are not accessible within function scopes.\\n\\n**5.2 Where the problem is located:**\\nFile: `/workspace/django__django__3.2/django/core/management/commands/shell.py`\\nLines: 87 and 93\\n- Line 87: `exec(options['command'])`\\n- Line 93: `exec(sys.stdin.read())`\\n\\n**5.3 How the test reproduces the issue:**\\nThe reproduction script creates code that:\\n1. Imports django in global scope\\n2. Defines a function that uses django\\n3. Calls the function\\nWhen executed via `django shell -c`, the function can't access the `django` variable because `exec()` was called without a proper globals dictionary.\\n\\n**5.4 Best practices to take into account:**\\n- The fix should be minimal and focused\\n- Should maintain backward compatibility\\n- Should follow the same pattern used elsewhere in the codebase (line 78 shows the correct pattern)\\n- Should provide a clean globals dictionary for execution\\n\\n**5.5 How to fix the problem:**\\nThe solution is to pass an empty dictionary as the second argument to `exec()` calls on lines 87 and 93. This creates a new globals namespace that allows proper variable scoping within functions.\\n\\nThe fix should be:\\n- Line 87: `exec(options['command'], {})`\\n- Line 93: `exec(sys.stdin.read(), {})`\\n\\nThis matches the pattern already used on line 78 in the same file for PYTHONSTARTUP execution.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_24", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 406, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 406, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
