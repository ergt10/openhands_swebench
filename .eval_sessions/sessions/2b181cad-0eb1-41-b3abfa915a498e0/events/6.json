The problem is about modules being imported twice when using import-mode=importlib in pytest\\n2. The user is switching from pkg_resources style namespace packaging to PEP 420 namespace packages\\n3. The issue manifests as two different versions of the same module existing simultaneously:\\n   - One in sys.modules['pmxbot.logging'] \\n   - Another found in tests.unit.test_commands.logging\\n4. This causes problems because initialization performed on one module instance doesn't affect the other\\n5. The specific error is that logging.Logger.store is not found even though core.initialize() should have set it up\\n\\nThis seems to be a pytest import mechanism issue where the same module is being imported through different paths, creating separate module objects in memory.\\n\\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure to understand how pytest handles imports and where the import-mode logic is implemented.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 229, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 229, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
