EXPLORATION: Finding the Root Cause\n\nNow let me explore the code to understand exactly what's happening:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"thought\": \"Now I understand the issue clearly. The problem is in the `contribute_to_class` method in `Field`. When a child model inherits from an abstract base model and overrides the choices, the `get_FOO_display` method is created with a reference to the parent field's choices instead of the child's choices.\\n\\nLet me trace through what happens:\\n1. Parent model A is created with field_foo having choices [(\\\"A\\\",\\\"output1\\\"),(\\\"B\\\",\\\"output2\\\")]\\n2. When field_foo contributes to class A, it creates get_field_foo_display method with field=self (parent field)\\n3. Child model B inherits from A and defines its own field_foo with choices [(\\\"A\\\",\\\"output1\\\"),(\\\"B\\\",\\\"output2\\\"),(\\\"C\\\",\\\"output3\\\")]\\n4. When field_foo contributes to class B, it should create get_field_foo_display with field=self (child field)\\n5. But somehow, the method is still referencing the parent field\\n\\nThe issue is likely in the `contribute_to_class` method where it checks `if not hasattr(cls, 'get_%s_display' % self.name):`. Since the child class inherits the method from the parent, this condition is False, so the child field doesn't create its own display method.\\n\\nThe fix should ensure that when a child model overrides a field with new choices, it creates its own display method that references the child field's choices.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_34", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 394, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 394, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
