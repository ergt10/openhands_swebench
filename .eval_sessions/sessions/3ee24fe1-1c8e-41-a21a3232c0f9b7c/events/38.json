Now let me analyze the problem and implement a fix.\n\n## Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: Understanding the problem\nThe problem is clear now:\n\n1. **What the problem is**: The `canvas` property in `DraggableBase` class is defined as `lambda self: self.ref_artist.figure.canvas`, but when `self.ref_artist.figure` becomes `None`, accessing `.canvas` on `None` raises an AttributeError.\n\n2. **Where the problem is located**: In `/workspace/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.7/lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py` at line 1511, the canvas property definition.\n\n3. **How the test reproduces the issue**: By setting `draggable.ref_artist.figure = None` and then accessing the `canvas` property or calling `disconnect()` method.\n\n4. **Best practices to consider**: \n   - Handle None gracefully without breaking existing functionality\n   - Maintain backward compatibility\n   - Make minimal changes\n   - Follow defensive programming practices\n\n5. **How to fix the problem**: \n   - Modify the canvas property to check if `self.ref_artist.figure` is None before accessing `.canvas`\n   - Also need to handle the same issue in the `disconnect()` method which uses `self.canvas.mpl_disconnect()`\n\nThe fix should:\n- Return None when figure is None (for the canvas property)\n- Skip disconnection when canvas is None (for the disconnect method)\n- This is safe because if the figure is None, the canvas should also be None/disconnected anyway", "action": "think", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "think", "tool_call_id": "toolu_17", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-13b317dd3b0c4137a1656e9b292bf2a0", "created": 1767714513, "model": "/mnt/shared/models/GLM-4.6-FP8", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "<think></think>\nPerfect!
