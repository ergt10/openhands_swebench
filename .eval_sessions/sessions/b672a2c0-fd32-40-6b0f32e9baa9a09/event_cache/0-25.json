The runtime may not support them and can cause unusable shell sessions.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

I've confirmed the issue. Both validators are incorrectly accepting usernames with trailing newlines (`testuser\\n`). Now let me understand the problem better and implement the fix.\n\n## Phase 1. READING: Problem Analysis\n\n**1.1 Problem Description:**\nThe `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes use the regex `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to validate usernames. The issue is that the `$` anchor in Python regex matches the end of string OR just before a trailing newline. This means usernames ending with `\\n` are incorrectly accepted as valid.\n\n**1.2 Technical Details:**\n- File: `/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/contrib/auth/validators.py`\n- Classes: `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`\n- Current regex: `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'`\n- Problem: `$` matches before trailing newline\n- Solution: Use `\\A` and `\\Z` anchors instead of `^` and `$`\n\n**1.3 Clear Problem Statement:**\nThe username validators allow usernames with trailing newlines, which should be rejected as invalid.\n\n**1.4 Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Create a username ending with `\\n` (e.g., \"testuser\\n\")\n2. Pass it to either validator\n3. The validator incorrectly accepts it as valid\n\n**1.5 Best Practices:**\n- Use `\\A` and `\\Z` for strict string boundary matching\n- Ensure backward compatibility\n- Test edge cases thoroughly\n\n## Phase 2. RUNNING: Environment Setup\n\nThe environment is already set up and I've confirmed the issue exists.\n\n## Phase 3. EXPLORATION: File Location\n\nI've already identified the file: `/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/contrib/auth/validators.py`\n\n## Phase 4. TEST CREATION: Done\n\nI've created and run the test script that confirms the issue.\n\n## Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS\n\n**5.1 Problem:** The regex `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` uses `$` which matches before trailing newlines.\n\n**5.2 Location:** Lines 10 and 20 in `/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/contrib/auth/validators.py`\n\n**5.3 Test Reproduction:** The test shows usernames with trailing newlines are incorrectly accepted.\n\n**5.4 Best Practices:** Use `\\A` and `\\Z` for strict string boundaries.\n\n**5.5 Fix:** Change the regex from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`\n\n## Phase 6.
