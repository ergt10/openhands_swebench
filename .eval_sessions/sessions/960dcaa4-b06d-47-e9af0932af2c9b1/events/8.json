The issue occurs when trying to pickle the figure.\n\n**1.2 Technical Details:**\n- Error message: `TypeError: cannot pickle 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object`\n- Method involved: `leg.set_draggable(True)`\n- The pickling works fine when the draggable line is removed\n- Affects both draggable legends and draggable annotations\n\n**1.3 Problem Explanation:**\nWhen a legend is made draggable, matplotlib likely adds some Qt-specific canvas references or event handlers that cannot be pickled. The `FigureCanvasQTAgg` object is not serializable by Python's pickle module.\n\n**1.4 Reproduction Steps:**\n1. Create a matplotlib figure\n2. Add a subplot with some data\n3. Create a legend\n4. Set the legend as draggable with `leg.set_draggable(True)`\n5. Attempt to pickle the figure with `pickle.dumps(fig)`\n\n**1.5 Best Practices:**\n- The fix should be minimal and not break existing functionality\n- Should handle both legends and annotations\n- Should maintain the draggable functionality after unpickling\n- Should not introduce security vulnerabilities\n\nLet me proceed to Phase 2:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"cat README.md\", \"security_risk\": \"LOW\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "toolu_02", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 327, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 327, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.0, "max_budget_per_task": null, "accumulated_token_usage": {"model": "default", "prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 415, "cache_read_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "context_window": 0, "per_turn_token": 327, "response_id": ""}, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": []}, "args": {"command": "cat README.md", "is_input": false, "thought": "<think></think>\nNow let me understand the problem clearly:\n\n### Phase 1.1-1.5: Problem Analysis\n\n**1.1 Code Analysis:**\nThe reproduction code creates a matplotlib figure with a plot and legend, then makes the legend draggable using `leg.set_draggable(True)`.
