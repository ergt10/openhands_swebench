Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug.

Fork `the repository`_ on Github to start making your changes to the **develop** branch (or branch off of it).\n    74\t#. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected.\n    75\t#. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published. :) Make sure to add yourself to AUTHORS_.\n    76\t\n    77\t.. _`the repository`: http://github.com/kennethreitz/requests\n    78\t.. _AUTHORS: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/develop/AUTHORS.rst\n    79\t\n", "extras": {"path": "/workspace/psf__requests__0.14/README.rst", "impl_source": "oh_aci"}}
