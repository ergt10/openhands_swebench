Now I have a clear understanding of the problem. Let me proceed with the phases:\n\n## Phase 1. READING: Problem Analysis\n\n**1.1 Problem Description in Clear Terms:**\nThe issue is in the `Request.__init__()` method in `/workspace/psf__requests__0.14/requests/models.py`. When a user passes a hooks dictionary with lists as values (e.g., `{'args': [hook1, hook2]}`), the current code treats the entire list as a single hook and wraps it in another list, resulting in `[[hook1, hook2]]`. When hooks are later dispatched, the code tries to call the list as a function, which fails since lists are not callable.\n\n**1.2 Technical Details:**\n- **Method names:** `Request.__init__()`, `register_hook()`, `dispatch_hook()`\n- **File names:** `/workspace/psf__requests__0.14/requests/models.py`, `/workspace/psf__requests__0.14/requests/hooks.py`\n- **Variables:** `hooks` parameter, `self.hooks` dictionary\n- **Error:** List is not callable when hooks are consumed\n\n**1.3 Problem Explanation:**\nThe current code at lines 151-152 in `models.py` iterates through the hooks dictionary and calls `register_hook()` for each key-value pair. If the value is a list, it gets appended as a single item to the hooks list, creating a nested list structure.\n\n**1.4 Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Create a Request with hooks containing lists: `Request(url='http://example.com', hooks={'args': [hook1, hook2]})`\n2. The hooks will be stored as `{'args': [[hook1, hook2]]}`\n3. When dispatched, `dispatch_hook()` tries to call `[hook1, hook2]` as a function, causing a TypeError\n\n**1.5 Best Practices:**\n- Maintain backward compatibility with single hook functions\n- Handle both single functions and lists of functions\n- Ensure hooks are stored as flat lists for proper dispatching\n\n## Phase 2.
