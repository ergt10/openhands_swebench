Below are a few steps you should take to make sure\n    58\tyour patch gets accepted:\n    59\t\n    60\t- We recommend using Python 3.8 or higher for development of Pylint as it gives\n    61\t  you access to the latest ``ast`` parser.\n    62\t\n    63\t- Install the dev dependencies, see :ref:`contributor_install`.\n    64\t\n    65\t- Use our test suite and write new tests, see :ref:`contributor_testing`.\n    66\t\n    67\t.. keep this in sync with the description of PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md!\n    68\t\n    69\t- Create a news fragment with `towncrier create <IssueNumber>.<type>` which will be\n    70\t  included in the changelog. `<type>` can be one of: new_check, removed_check, extension,\n    71\t  false_positive, false_negative, bugfix, other, internal. If necessary you can write\n    72\t  details or offer examples on how the new change is supposed to work.\n    73\t\n    74\t- Document your change, if it is a non-trivial one.\n    75\t\n    76\t- If you used multiple emails or multiple names when contributing, add your mails\n    77\t  and preferred name in the ``script/.contributors_aliases.json`` file.\n    78\t\n    79\t- Write a comprehensive commit message\n    80\t\n    81\t- Relate your change to an issue in the tracker if such an issue exists (see\n    82\t  `Closing issues via commit messages`_ of the GitHub documentation for more\n    83\t  information on this)\n    84\t\n    85\t- Send a pull request from GitHub (see `About pull requests`_ for more insight\n    86\t  about this topic)\n    87\t\n    88\t.. _`Closing issues via commit messages`: https://github.blog/2013-01-22-closing-issues-via-commit-messages/\n    89\t.. _`About pull requests`: https://support.github.com/features/pull-requests\n    90\t.. _tox: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n    91\t.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/\n    92\t.. _black: https://github.com/psf/black\n    93\t.. _isort: https://github.com/PyCQA/isort\n    94\t.. _astroid: https://github.com/pycqa/astroid\n    95\t\n    96\t\n    97\tTips for Getting Started with Pylint Development\n    98\t------------------------------------------------\n    99\t* Read the :ref:`technical-reference`. It gives a short walk through of the pylint\n   100\t  codebase and will help you identify where you will need to make changes\n   101\t  for what you are trying to implement.\n   102\t\n   103\t* ``astroid.extract_node`` is your friend. Most checkers are AST based,\n   104\t  so you will likely need to interact with ``astroid``.\n   105\t  A short example of how to use ``astroid.extract_node`` is given\n   106\t  :ref:`here <astroid_extract_node>`.\n   107\t\n   108\t* When fixing a bug for a specific check, search the code for the warning\n   109\t  message to find where the warning is raised,\n   110\t  and therefore where the logic for that code exists.\n   111\t\n   112\t* When adding a new checker class you can use the :file:`get_unused_message_id_category.py`\n   113\t  script in :file:`./script` to get a message id that is not used by\n   114\t  any of the other checkers.\n   115\t\n   116\tBuilding the documentation\n   117\t----------------------------\n   118\t\n   119\tYou can use the makefile in the doc directory with ``make html`` to build the\n   120\tdocumentation. To test smaller changes you can consider ``build-html``, which skips some checks but will be faster::\n   121\t\n   122\t  $ cd doc\n   123\t  $ make install-dependencies\n   124\t  $ make build-html\n   125\t\n   126\tWe're reusing generated files for speed, use ``make clean`` when you want to start from scratch.\n   127\t\n   128\tHow to choose the target version ?\n   129\t----------------------------------\n   130\t\n   131\tChoose depending on the kind of change you're doing:\n   132\t\n   133\t.. include:: patch_release.rst\n   134\t.. include:: minor_release.rst\n   135\t.. include:: major_release.rst\n   136\t\n", "extras": {"path": "/workspace/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/doc/development_guide/contributor_guide/contribute.rst", "impl_source": "oh_aci"}}
