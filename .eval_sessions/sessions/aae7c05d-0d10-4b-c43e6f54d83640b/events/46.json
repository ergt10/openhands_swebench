FIX ANALYSIS: Clear Problem Statement\n\n**5.1 What the problem is:**\nThe QuerySet.Delete method returns inconsistent result formats when zero objects are deleted:\n- Models with foreign keys: `(0, {'app.Model': 0})` - dictionary with model label and zero value\n- Simple models without foreign keys: `(0, {})` - empty dictionary\n\n**5.2 Where the problem is located:**\nThe problem is in the `Collector.delete()` method in `/workspace/django__django__3.1/django/db/models/deletion.py`, specifically in how the `deleted_counter` is populated.\n\n**5.3 How the test reproduces the issue:**\nThe reproduction script creates two models - one simple and one with foreign keys - and calls `delete()` on empty QuerySets for both. The results show the inconsistent dictionary formats.\n\n**5.4 Best practices to consider:**\n- Maintain API consistency across different model types\n- Provide complete information about deletion attempts\n- Make minimal changes to existing behavior\n- Ensure backward compatibility\n\n**5.5 How to fix the problem:**\nThe fix should ensure that when a QuerySet is deleted, the model is always added to the `deleted_counter`, even if the count is 0. This will make the behavior consistent between models with and without foreign keys.\n\nLooking at the code, the issue is that in the normal deletion path, models only get added to `deleted_counter` when they are actually processed for deletion. For simple models without foreign keys, when no objects exist, they don't get processed at all.\n\nThe fix should be in the `QuerySet.delete()` method to ensure the model is always represented in the result.\n\n## Phase 6.
