This caused HTTP requests to fail with 404 errors because the server received an invalid HTTP method.\\n\\n## Root Cause\\n- `builtin_str` in Python 3 converts bytes objects to their string representation (e.g., `b'GET'` \\u2192 `\\\"b'GET'\\\"`)\\n- `to_native_string` properly decodes bytes to native strings (e.g., `b'GET'` \\u2192 `'GET'`)\\n- The issue occurred when neutronclient converted all arguments to binary strings, including the HTTP method\\n\\n## Solution Implemented\\nChanged line 428 in `/workspace/psf__requests__2.4/requests/sessions.py`:\\n- From: `method = builtin_str(method)`\\n- To: `method = to_native_string(method)`\\n\\n## Testing\\n1. Created reproduction scripts that confirmed the issue and verified the fix\\n2. Created comprehensive test suite covering binary, string, and unicode methods\\n3. Ran existing tests to ensure no regression\\n4. All tests pass successfully\\n\\n## Impact\\n- Fixes the issue for neutronclient and other libraries that pass binary string methods\\n- Maintains backward compatibility for string and unicode methods\\n- Minimal, focused change that addresses the root cause\\n- No breaking changes to the API\\n\\nThe fix is complete and thoroughly tested.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_43", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 348, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 348, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
