When doing this in a single migration, they get an error: \\\"ValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints for app_authors(project_data_set, state, start_date)\\\"\\n4. The workaround is to do it in 2 separate migrations: first remove unique_together, then change the field type\\n5. They want to be able to do this in a single migration\\n\\nThe core issue seems to be that Django's migration system is not properly handling the case where:\\n- A field changes from ForeignKey to ManyToManyField \\n- AND a unique_together constraint that included that field is removed in the same migration\\n\\nLet me start by exploring the Django codebase to understand how migrations handle field changes and constraint management.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 236, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 236, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
