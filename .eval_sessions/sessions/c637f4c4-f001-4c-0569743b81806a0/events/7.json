The problem is with `TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback = True` which triggers rollback emulation\\n2. The issue occurs during deserialization when objects with foreign keys are restored in the wrong order\\n3. The `deserialize_db_from_string` method doesn't wrap the deserialization in a transaction, unlike `loaddata` command\\n4. This can cause integrity errors when a foreign key reference is saved before the referenced object\\n5. The proposed fix is to wrap the deserialization in a transaction using `transaction.atomic()`\\n\\nThe key files involved are:\\n- `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` - contains the `deserialize_db_from_string` method that needs fixing\\n- The method needs to wrap the deserialization loop in a transaction\\n\\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure and understanding the current implementation.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 223, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 223, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
