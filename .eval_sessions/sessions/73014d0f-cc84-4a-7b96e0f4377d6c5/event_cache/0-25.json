The runtime may not support them and can cause unusable shell sessions.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4.

Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

You can usually figure out which\n    39\tpackage to install by doing a web search for the last line or so of the error\n    40\tmessage. Try adding your operating system to the search query if needed.\n    41\t\n    42\tIf you have trouble installing the requirements, you can skip that step. See\n    43\t:ref:`running-unit-tests-dependencies` for details on installing the optional\n    44\ttest dependencies. If you don't have an optional dependency installed, the\n    45\ttests that require it will be skipped.\n    46\t\n    47\tRunning the tests requires a Django settings module that defines the databases\n    48\tto use. To help you get started, Django provides and uses a sample settings\n    49\tmodule that uses the SQLite database. See :ref:`running-unit-tests-settings` to\n    50\tlearn how to use a different settings module to run the tests with a different\n    51\tdatabase.\n    52\t\n    53\tHaving problems? See :ref:`troubleshooting-unit-tests` for some common issues.\n    54\t\n    55\tRunning tests using ``tox``\n    56\t---------------------------\n    57\t\n    58\t`Tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/>`_ is a tool for running tests in different\n    59\tvirtual environments. Django includes a basic ``tox.ini`` that automates some\n    60\tchecks that our build server performs on pull requests. To run the unit tests\n    61\tand other checks (such as :ref:`import sorting <coding-style-imports>`, the\n    62\t:ref:`documentation spelling checker <documentation-spelling-check>`, and\n    63\t:ref:`code formatting <coding-style-python>`), install and run the ``tox``\n    64\tcommand from any place in the Django source tree:\n    65\t\n    66\t.. console::\n    67\t\n    68\t    $ python -m pip install tox\n    69\t    $ tox\n    70\t\n    71\tBy default, ``tox`` runs the test suite with the bundled test settings file for\n    72\tSQLite, ``flake8``, ``isort``, and the documentation spelling checker. In\n    73\taddition to the system dependencies noted elsewhere in this documentation,\n    74\tthe command ``python3`` must be on your path and linked to the appropriate\n    75\tversion of Python. A list of default environments can be seen as follows:\n    76\t\n    77\t.. console::\n    78\t\n    79\t    $ tox -l\n    80\t    py3\n    81\t    flake8\n    82\t    docs\n    83\t    isort>=5.1.0\n    84\t\n    85\tTesting other Python versions and database backends\n    86\t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    87\t\n    88\tIn addition to the default environments, ``tox`` supports running unit tests\n    89\tfor other versions of Python and other database backends. Since Django's test\n    90\tsuite doesn't bundle a settings file for database backends other than SQLite,\n    91\thowever, you must :ref:`create and provide your own test settings\n    92\t<running-unit-tests-settings>`. For example, to run the tests on Python 3.9\n    93\tusing PostgreSQL:\n    94\t\n    95\t.. console::\n    96\t\n    97\t    $ tox -e py39-postgres -- --settings=my_postgres_settings\n    98\t\n    99\tThis command sets up a Python 3.9 virtual environment, installs Django's\n   100\ttest suite dependencies (including those for PostgreSQL), and calls\n   101\t``runtests.py`` with the supplied arguments (in this case,\n   102\t``--settings=my_postgres_settings``).\n   103\t\n   104\tThe remainder of this documentation shows commands for running tests without\n   105\t``tox``, however, any option passed to ``runtests.py`` can also be passed to\n   106\t``tox`` by prefixing the argument list with ``--``, as above.\n   107\t\n   108\tTox also respects the :envvar:`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable, if\n   109\tset. For example, the following is equivalent to the command above:\n   110\t\n   111\t.. code-block:: console\n   112\t\n   113\t    $ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=my_postgres_settings tox -e py39-postgres\n   114\t\n   115\tWindows users should use:\n   116\t\n   117\t.. code-block:: doscon\n   118\t\n   119\t    ...\\> set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=my_postgres_settings\n   120\t    ...\\> tox -e py39-postgres\n   121\t\n   122\tRunning the JavaScript tests\n   123\t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n   124\t\n   125\tDjango includes a set of :ref:`JavaScript unit tests <javascript-tests>` for\n   126\tfunctions in certain contrib apps. The JavaScript tests aren't run by default\n   127\tusing ``tox`` because they require ``Node.js`` to be installed and aren't\n   128\tnecessary for the majority of patches. To run the JavaScript tests using\n   129\t``tox``:\n   130\t\n   131\t.. console::\n   132\t\n   133\t    $ tox -e javascript\n   134\t\n   135\tThis command runs ``npm install`` to ensure test requirements are up to\n   136\tdate and then runs ``npm test``.\n   137\t\n   138\tRunning tests using ``django-docker-box``\n   139\t-----------------------------------------\n   140\t\n   141\t`django-docker-box`_ allows you to run the Django's test suite across all\n   142\tsupported databases and python versions. See the `django-docker-box`_ project\n   143\tpage for installation and usage instructions.\n   144\t\n   145\t.. _django-docker-box: https://github.com/django/django-docker-box/\n   146\t\n   147\t.. _running-unit-tests-settings:\n   148\t\n   149\tUsing another ``settings`` module\n   150\t---------------------------------\n   151\t\n   152\tThe included settings module (``tests/test_sqlite.py``) allows you to run the\n   153\ttest suite using SQLite. If you want to run the tests using a different\n   154\tdatabase, you'll need to define your own settings file. Some tests, such as\n   155\tthose for ``contrib.postgres``, are specific to a particular database backend\n   156\tand will be skipped if run with a different backend. Some tests are skipped or\n   157\texpected failures on a particular database backend (see\n   158\t``DatabaseFeatures.django_test_skips`` and\n   159\t``DatabaseFeatures.django_test_expected_failures`` on each backend).\n   160\t\n   161\tTo run the tests with different settings, ensure that the module is on your\n   162\t:envvar:`PYTHONPATH` and pass the module with ``--settings``.\n   163\t\n   164\tThe :setting:`DATABASES` setting in any test settings module needs to define\n   165\ttwo databases:\n   166\t\n   167\t* A ``default`` database. This database should use the backend that\n   168\t  you want to use for primary testing.\n   169\t\n   170\t* A database with the alias ``other``. The ``other`` database is used to test\n   171\t  that queries can be directed to different databases. This database should use\n   172\t  the same backend as the ``default``, and it must have a different name.\n   173\t\n   174\tIf you're using a backend that isn't SQLite, you will need to provide other\n   175\tdetails for each database:\n   176\t\n   177\t* The :setting:`USER` option needs to specify an existing user account\n   178\t  for the database. That user needs permission to execute ``CREATE DATABASE``\n   179\t  so that the test database can be created.\n   180\t\n   181\t* The :setting:`PASSWORD` option needs to provide the password for\n   182\t  the :setting:`USER` that has been specified.\n   183\t\n   184\tTest databases get their names by prepending ``test_`` to the value of the\n   185\t:setting:`NAME` settings for the databases defined in :setting:`DATABASES`.\n   186\tThese test databases are deleted when the tests are finished.\n   187\t\n   188\tYou will also need to ensure that your database uses UTF-8 as the default\n   189\tcharacter set. If your database server doesn't use UTF-8 as a default charset,\n   190\tyou will need to include a value for :setting:`CHARSET <TEST_CHARSET>` in the\n   191\ttest settings dictionary for the applicable database.\n   192\t\n   193\t.. _runtests-specifying-labels:\n   194\t\n   195\tRunning only some of the tests\n   196\t------------------------------\n   197\t\n   198\tDjango's entire test suite takes a while to run, and running every single test\n   199\tcould be redundant if, say, you just added a test to Django that you want to\n   200\trun quickly without running everything else. You can run a subset of the unit\n   201\ttests by appending the names of the test modules to ``runtests.py`` on the\n   202\tcommand line.\n   203\t\n   204\tFor example, if you'd like to run tests only for generic relations and\n   205\tinternationalization, type:\n   206\t\n   207\t.. console::\n   208\t\n   209\t   $ ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings generic_relations i18n\n   210\t\n   211\tHow do you find out the names of individual tests? Look in ``tests/`` \u2014 each\n   212\tdirectory name there is the name of a test.\n   213\t\n   214\tIf you want to run only a particular class of tests, you can specify a list of\n   215\tpaths to individual test classes. For example, to run the ``TranslationTests``\n   216\tof the ``i18n`` module, type:\n   217\t\n   218\t.. console::\n   219\t\n   220\t   $ ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings i18n.tests.TranslationTests\n   221\t\n   222\tGoing beyond that, you can specify an individual test method like this:\n   223\t\n   224\t.. console::\n   225\t\n   226\t   $ ./runtests.py --settings=path.to.settings i18n.tests.TranslationTests.test_lazy_objects\n   227\t\n   228\tYou can run tests starting at a specified top-level module with ``--start-at``\n   229\toption. For example:\n   230\t\n   231\t.. console::\n   232\t\n   233\t   $ ./runtests.py --start-at=wsgi\n   234\t\n   235\tYou can also run tests starting after a specified top-level module with\n   236\t``--start-after`` option. For example:\n   237\t\n   238\t.. console::\n   239\t\n   240\t   $ ./runtests.py --start-after=wsgi\n   241\t\n   242\tNote that the ``--reverse`` option doesn't impact on ``--start-at`` or\n   243\t``--start-after`` options. Moreover these options cannot be used with test\n   244\tlabels.\n   245\t\n   246\tRunning the Selenium tests\n   247\t--------------------------\n   248\t\n   249\tSome tests require Selenium and a web browser. To run these tests, you must\n   250\tinstall the selenium_ package and run the tests with the\n   251\t``--selenium=<BROWSERS>`` option. For example, if you have Firefox and Google\n   252\tChrome installed:\n   253\t\n   254\t.. console::\n   255\t\n   256\t   $ ./runtests.py --selenium=firefox,chrome\n   257\t\n   258\tSee the `selenium.webdriver`_ package for the list of available browsers.\n   259\t\n   260\tSpecifying ``--selenium`` automatically sets ``--tags=selenium`` to run only\n   261\tthe tests that require selenium.\n   262\t\n   263\tSome browsers (e.g. Chrome or Firefox) support headless testing, which can be\n   264\tfaster and more stable. Add the ``--headless`` option to enable this mode.\n   265\t\n   266\t.. _selenium.webdriver: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver\n   267\t\n   268\t.. _running-unit-tests-dependencies:\n   269\t\n   270\tRunning all the tests\n   271\t---------------------\n   272\t\n   273\tIf you want to run the full suite of tests, you'll need to install a number of\n   274\tdependencies:\n   275\t\n   276\t*  aiosmtpd_\n   277\t*  argon2-cffi_ 19.1.0+\n   278\t*  asgiref_ 3.4.1+ (required)\n   279\t*  bcrypt_\n   280\t*  colorama_\n   281\t*  docutils_\n   282\t*  geoip2_\n   283\t*  jinja2_ 2.7+\n   284\t*  numpy_\n   285\t*  Pillow_ 6.2.0+\n   286\t*  PyYAML_\n   287\t*  pytz_ (required)\n   288\t*  pywatchman_\n   289\t*  redis_\n   290\t*  setuptools_\n   291\t*  memcached_, plus a :ref:`supported Python binding <memcached>`\n   292\t*  gettext_ (:ref:`gettext_on_windows`)\n   293\t*  selenium_\n   294\t*  sqlparse_ 0.2.2+ (required)\n   295\t*  tblib_ 1.5.0+\n   296\t\n   297\tYou can find these dependencies in `pip requirements files`_ inside the\n   298\t``tests/requirements`` directory of the Django source tree and install them\n   299\tlike so:\n   300\t\n   301\t.. console::\n   302\t\n   303\t   $ python -m pip install -r tests/requirements/py3.txt\n   304\t\n   305\tIf you encounter an error during the installation, your system might be missing\n   306\ta dependency for one or more of the Python packages.
