The problem is with Subquery.as_sql() method generating invalid SQL\\n2. The issue is that it removes first and last symbols instead of adding brackets\\n3. The workaround is setting `q.query.subquery = True` attribute\\n4. The user suggests this should be set in the Subquery constructor\\n5. The example shows:\\n   - str(q.query) outputs valid SQL: 'SELECT \\\"apps_app\\\".\\\"id\\\", \\\"apps_app\\\".\\\"name\\\" FROM \\\"apps_app\\\"'\\n   - q.as_sql() outputs invalid SQL: '(ELECT \\\"apps_app\\\".\\\"id\\\", \\\"apps_app\\\".\\\"name\\\" FROM \\\"apps_app)' (missing 'S' at start and extra '\\\"' at end)\\n   - After setting q.query.subquery = True, it outputs correct SQL: '(SELECT \\\"apps_app\\\".\\\"id\\\", \\\"apps_app\\\".\\\"name\\\" FROM \\\"apps_app\\\")'\\n\\nThis suggests that the as_sql() method is incorrectly handling the SQL generation when subquery flag is not set, causing it to strip characters incorrectly instead of properly wrapping the query in parentheses.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 269, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 269, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
