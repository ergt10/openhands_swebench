The regex pattern on line 63 is:\\n\\n```python\\n_command_re = r\\\"READ [TS]ERR(\\\\s+[0-9]+)+\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis only matches uppercase \\\"READ\\\". To fix this, I need to make it case-insensitive. I can do this by:\\n1. Adding the `re.IGNORECASE` flag when compiling the regex\\n2. Or by using a case-insensitive pattern like `[Rr][Ee][Aa][Dd]`\\n\\nThe cleaner approach is to use the `re.IGNORECASE` flag. Looking at line 71, the regex is compiled as:\\n```python\\n_line_type_re = re.compile(_type_re)\\n```\\n\\nI need to add the `re.IGNORECASE` flag here. However, I should be careful because this might affect other parts of the regex. Let me check what the full regex pattern looks like.\\n\\nThe full pattern on line 70 is:\\n```python\\n_type_re = rf\\\"^\\\\s*((?P<command>{_command_re})|(?P<new>{_new_re})|(?P<data>{_data_re})?\\\\s*(\\\\!(?P<comment>.*))?\\\\s*$\\\"\\n```\\n\\nSince the command part is what needs to be case-insensitive, and the other parts (data, comments) should remain case-sensitive, I should modify the `_command_re` pattern to be case-insensitive on its own, or use inline flags.\\n\\nActually, looking more carefully, the best approach is to modify the `_command_re` to use inline case-insensitive flag: `(?i:READ [TS]ERR(\\\\s+[0-9]+)+)`\\n\\nThis way, only the command part is case-insensitive, and the rest of the regex remains case-sensitive.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_07", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 436, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 436, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
