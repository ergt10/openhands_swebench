However, I'm still getting the new template deprecation warning because of the formset management form production, during which the template used is insignificant (only hidden inputs are produced). Is it worth special-casing this and avoid producing the warning for the management forms?\\\"\\n\\nKey requirements:\\n1. ManagementForm should not trigger the default.html deprecation warning\\n2. This is because ManagementForm only renders hidden inputs where template choice is insignificant\\n3. The fix should be special-casing for ManagementForm\\n4. Regular forms should still trigger the warning\\n\\nMy solution:\\n1. \\u2705 I overrode the render() method in ManagementForm to skip the deprecation warning check\\n2. \\u2705 I also overrode __str__ and __html__ to point to the new render method\\n3. \\u2705 The fix is minimal and targeted - only affects ManagementForm\\n4. \\u2705 Regular forms and formsets still trigger the warning as expected\\n5. \\u2705 All existing tests pass\\n6. \\u2705 I created comprehensive tests to verify the fix works correctly\\n\\nThe solution is complete and addresses all requirements in the issue description.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_43", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 299, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 299, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
