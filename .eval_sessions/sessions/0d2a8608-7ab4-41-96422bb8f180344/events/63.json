I've successfully reproduced the issue. The ManagementForm is indeed triggering the deprecation warning even though it only renders hidden inputs.\n\n## Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: Understanding the problem and solution\n\n**5.1 Problem Statement:**\nManagementForm inherits from Form, which uses the default template \"django/forms/default.html\". When rendered, it triggers the deprecation warning in `RenderableMixin.render()` method, even though ManagementForm only renders hidden inputs where the template choice is insignificant.\n\n**5.2 Problem Location:**\n- The warning is triggered in `/workspace/django__django__4.2/django/forms/utils.py` in the `RenderableMixin.render()` method (lines 68-74)\n- ManagementForm is defined in `/workspace/django__django__4.2/django/forms/formsets.py` (line 28)\n- ManagementForm inherits from Form, which gets its template_name from the renderer\n\n**5.3 How the test reproduces the issue:**\nThe reproduction script creates a formset, accesses its management_form property, and renders it as a string. This triggers the `__str__` method, which calls `render()`, which checks the template name and raises the warning.\n\n**5.4 Best practices for the fix:**\n- The fix should be minimal and targeted\n- Should not affect regular form rendering behavior\n- Should specifically target ManagementForm\n- Should preserve the deprecation warning for regular forms\n\n**5.5 How to fix the problem:**\nThe best approach is to override the `render()` method in ManagementForm to skip the deprecation warning check. Since ManagementForm only renders hidden inputs, the template choice is indeed insignificant.\n\n## Phase 6.
