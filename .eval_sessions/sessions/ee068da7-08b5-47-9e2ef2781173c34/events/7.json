The user wants to use FilePathField with a path that can be different on different machines\\n2. Currently, when using `os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir')`, Django resolves this at model definition time\\n3. When `makemigrations` runs, it hardcodes the resolved path (e.g., `/home/<username>/server_files/example_dir`) into the migration\\n4. This breaks when running migrations on production/other machines where the path is different\\n5. The solution should allow the path parameter to accept a callable that gets evaluated at runtime, not at model definition time\\n\\nThis is a common pattern in Django where certain field parameters should be callable to allow for dynamic evaluation.\\n\\nLet me start by exploring the codebase to understand how FilePathField works and where the path parameter is processed.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 222, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 222, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
