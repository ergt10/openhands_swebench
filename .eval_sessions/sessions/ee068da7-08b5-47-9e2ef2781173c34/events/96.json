FIX ANALYSIS: Understanding the solution**\\n\\nFrom the reproduction script, I can see:\\n\\n1. **The Problem**: When using `os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir')`, the path is evaluated at model definition time and hardcoded as `/home/username/server_files/example_dir` in the migration.\\n\\n2. **Current Behavior**: \\n   - FilePathField accepts a string path and stores it directly\\n   - The path is serialized as-is in migrations\\n   - This breaks when the migration runs on a different machine\\n\\n3. **Desired Behavior**:\\n   - FilePathField should accept a callable for the path parameter\\n   - The callable should be evaluated at runtime when needed\\n   - The callable should be properly serialized in migrations\\n\\n**Key Areas to Fix**:\\n\\n1. **FilePathField.__init__**: Accept callable paths and store them appropriately\\n2. **Path evaluation**: Create a method to get the evaluated path (call if callable, return if string)\\n3. **deconstruct() method**: Handle serialization of callable paths for migrations\\n4. **formfield() method**: Pass the evaluated path to the form field\\n5. **Form FilePathField**: Update to handle callable paths as well\\n\\n**Implementation Strategy**:\\n\\n1. Store the original path (string or callable) as `self.path`\\n2. Create a property or method `get_path()` that returns the evaluated path\\n3. Update all places that use `self.path` to use the evaluated path\\n4. Update `deconstruct()` to handle callable serialization\\n5. Update the form field to handle callable paths\\n\\n**Migration Serialization**:\\n- For callables, we need to serialize them in a way that can be imported\\n- Django's migration serializer already handles functions and classes\\n- We need to ensure the callable is properly serialized\\n\\nLet me implement this step by step.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_40", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 422, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 422, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
