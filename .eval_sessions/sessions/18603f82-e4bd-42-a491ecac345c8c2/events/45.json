Now let me proceed with the analysis and fix.\n\n## Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: Understanding the Problem and Solution\nNow I have a clear understanding of the issue:\n\n**5.1 Problem Statement:**\nThe StatReloader only watches files that are in `sys.modules` (imported modules), but `manage.py` is executed as a script, not imported as a module. Therefore, `manage.py` is not in `sys.modules` and is not being watched for changes.\n\n**5.2 Problem Location:**\nThe issue is in the `iter_all_python_module_files()` function in `/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/utils/autoreload.py`. It only looks at modules in `sys.modules` and doesn't consider the main script file (`sys.argv[0]`).\n\n**5.3 How the Test Reproduces the Issue:**\nThe test creates a temporary `manage.py` file, sets `sys.argv[0]` to point to it, and then checks if the StatReloader watches it. The test confirms that `manage.py` is not in the watched files list.\n\n**5.4 Best Practices for the Fix:**\n- The fix should be minimal and focused\n- Should only add the main script file if it exists and is a Python file\n- Should handle both `python manage.py` and `python -m django` cases\n- Should not break existing functionality\n- Should be consistent with how Django handles file watching\n\n**5.5 How to Fix the Problem:**\nThe solution is to modify `iter_all_python_module_files()` to also include the main script file (`sys.argv[0]`) when it's a Python file that exists on the filesystem. This should be done in addition to the existing module watching logic.\n\nThe fix should:\n1. Check if `sys.argv[0]` points to an existing Python file\n2. If so, add it to the list of files to watch\n3. Ensure this works for both `python manage.py` and `python -m django` cases\n4.
