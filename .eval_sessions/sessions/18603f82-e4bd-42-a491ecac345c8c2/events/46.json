The reproduction script confirms the issue. Now let me proceed with the analysis and fix.\n\n## Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: Understanding the Problem and Solution", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"thought\": \"Now I have a clear understanding of the issue:\\n\\n**5.1 Problem Statement:**\\nThe StatReloader only watches files that are in `sys.modules` (imported modules), but `manage.py` is executed as a script, not imported as a module. Therefore, `manage.py` is not in `sys.modules` and is not being watched for changes.\\n\\n**5.2 Problem Location:**\\nThe issue is in the `iter_all_python_module_files()` function in `/workspace/django__django__3.0/django/utils/autoreload.py`. It only looks at modules in `sys.modules` and doesn't consider the main script file (`sys.argv[0]`).\\n\\n**5.3 How the Test Reproduces the Issue:**\\nThe test creates a temporary `manage.py` file, sets `sys.argv[0]` to point to it, and then checks if the StatReloader watches it. The test confirms that `manage.py` is not in the watched files list.\\n\\n**5.4 Best Practices for the Fix:**\\n- The fix should be minimal and focused\\n- Should only add the main script file if it exists and is a Python file\\n- Should handle both `python manage.py` and `python -m django` cases\\n- Should not break existing functionality\\n- Should be consistent with how Django handles file watching\\n\\n**5.5 How to Fix the Problem:**\\nThe solution is to modify `iter_all_python_module_files()` to also include the main script file (`sys.argv[0]`) when it's a Python file that exists on the filesystem. This should be done in addition to the existing module watching logic.\\n\\nThe fix should:\\n1. Check if `sys.argv[0]` points to an existing Python file\\n2. If so, add it to the list of files to watch\\n3. Ensure this works for both `python manage.py` and `python -m django` cases\\n4. Only add the file if it's not already being watched through other means\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_20", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 469, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 469, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
