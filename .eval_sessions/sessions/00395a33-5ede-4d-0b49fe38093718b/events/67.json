Specifically:\\n\\n1. **Problem location**: `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` in the `ensure_schema()` method\\n2. **Root cause**: The method creates the migration table without checking if migrations are allowed for that database\\n3. **Impact**: Migration tables are created on all databases during test setup, even when routers disallow it\\n\\n## Solution Design\\n\\nLooking at how other parts of Django handle this, I need to:\\n\\n1. **Import the router**: Add `from django.db import router` to recorder.py\\n2. **Check allow_migrate**: In `ensure_schema()`, check `router.allow_migrate()` before creating the table\\n3. **Handle the migration model**: The Migration model has app_label='migrations', so I should check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, 'migrations')`\\n4. **Graceful handling**: If migrations aren't allowed, the method should return early without creating the table\\n\\n## Implementation Plan\\n\\n1. Import router module\\n2. Modify `ensure_schema()` to check router.allow_migrate() before creating table\\n3. Modify `applied_migrations()` to handle the case where table doesn't exist due to router restrictions\\n4. Modify `record_applied()` and `record_unapplied()` to handle router restrictions gracefully\\n\\nThe key insight is that the Migration model has `app_label = 'migrations'`, so I should check `router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, 'migrations')`.\\n\\nThis follows the same pattern used in migration operations where they check `router.allow_migrate()` before performing operations.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_30", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 373, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 373, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
