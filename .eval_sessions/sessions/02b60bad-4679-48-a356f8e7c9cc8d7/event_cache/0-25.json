The runtime may not support them and can cause unusable shell sessions.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4.

Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool. Proactive task management demonstrates\nsystematic approach and ensures comprehensive requirement fulfillment.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string", "enum": ["view", "plan"], "description": "The command to execute. `view` shows the current task list. `plan` creates or updates the task list based on provided requirements and progress.

Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

In 5.x this treated the failing test like a a test marked statically with an `xfail`.

already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__6.0 directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 7f7a36478abe7dd1fa993b115d22606aa0e35e88.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "<uploaded_files>\n/workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__6.0\n</uploaded_files>\n\nI've uploaded a python code repository in the directory pytest-dev__pytest__6.0. Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nPytest 6: Dynamically adding xfail marker in test no longer ignores failure\n<!--\r\nThanks for submitting an issue!\r\n\r\nHere's a quick checklist for what to provide:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nWith pytest 5.x, we can dynamically add an xfail to a test `request` object using `request.node.add_marker(mark)` (see example below). In 5.x this treated the failing test like a a test marked statically with an `xfail`.

already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__6.0 directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 7f7a36478abe7dd1fa993b115d22606aa0e35e88.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning.

In 5.x this treated the failing test like a a test marked statically with an `xfail`.

already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__6.0 directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 7f7a36478abe7dd1fa993b115d22606aa0e35e88.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.", "thought": ""}}, {"id": 3, "timestamp": "2026-01-06T16:15:15.698716", "source": "environment", "message": "", "observation": "agent_state_changed", "content": "", "extras": {"agent_state": "running", "reason": ""}}, {"id": 4, "timestamp": "2026-01-06T16:15:15.701599", "source": "environment", "message": "Added workspace context", "cause": 2, "observation": "recall", "content": "Added workspace context", "extras": {"recall_type": "workspace_context", "repo_name": "", "repo_directory": "", "repo_branch": "", "repo_instructions": "", "runtime_hosts": {"http://localhost:54262": 54262, "http://localhost:55904": 55904}, "additional_agent_instructions": "", "date": "2026-01-06", "custom_secrets_descriptions": {}, "conversation_instructions": "", "working_dir": "/workspace", "microagent_knowledge": [{"name": "ssh", "trigger": "ssh", "content": "# SSH Microagent\n\nThis microagent provides capabilities for establishing and managing SSH connections to remote machines.\n\n## Capabilities\n\n- Establish SSH connections using password or key-based authentication\n- Generate and manage SSH key pairs\n- Configure SSH for easier connections\n- Execute commands on remote machines\n- Transfer files between local and remote machines\n- Manage SSH configurations and known hosts\n\n## Authentication Methods\n\n### Password Authentication\n\n```bash\nssh username@hostname\n```\n\nWhen prompted, you should ask the user for their password or a private key.\n\n### Key-Based Authentication\n\nGenerate a new SSH key pair:\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/key_name -C \"comment\" -N \"\"\n```\n\nCopy the public key to the remote server:\n```bash\nssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/key_name.pub username@hostname\n```\n\nConnect using the private key:\n```bash\nssh -i ~/.ssh/key_name username@hostname\n```\n\n## SSH Configuration\n\nCreate or edit the SSH config file for easier connections:\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.ssh\ncat > ~/.ssh/config << 'EOF'\nHost alias\n    HostName hostname_or_ip\n    User username\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key_name\n    Port 22\n    ServerAliveInterval 60\nEOF\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/config\n```\n\nThen connect using the alias:\n```bash\nssh alias\n```\n\n## Common SSH Options\n\n- `-p PORT`: Connect to a specific port\n- `-X`: Enable X11 forwarding\n- `-L local_port:remote_host:remote_port`: Set up local port forwarding\n- `-R remote_port:local_host:local_port`: Set up remote port forwarding\n- `-N`: Do not execute a remote command (useful for port forwarding)\n- `-f`: Run in background\n- `-v`: Verbose mode (add more v's for increased verbosity)\n\n## File Transfer with SCP\n\nCopy a file to the remote server:\n```bash\nscp /path/to/local/file username@hostname:/path/to/remote/directory/\n```\n\nCopy a file from the remote server:\n```bash\nscp username@hostname:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/directory/\n```\n\nCopy a directory recursively:\n```bash\nscp -r /path/to/local/directory username@hostname:/path/to/remote/directory/\n```\n\n## SSH Agent\n\nStart the SSH agent:\n```bash\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n```\n\nAdd a key to the agent:\n```bash\nssh-add ~/.ssh/key_name\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- Check SSH service status on remote: `systemctl status sshd`\n- Verify SSH port is open: `nc -zv hostname 22`\n- Debug connection issues: `ssh -vvv username@hostname`\n- Check permissions: SSH private keys should have 600 permissions (`chmod 600 ~/.ssh/key_name`)\n- Verify known_hosts: If host key changed, remove the old entry with `ssh-keygen -R hostname`\n\n## Secure SSH Key Management\n\n### Local Storage with Proper Permissions\n\nThe most basic approach is to ensure proper file permissions:\n\n```bash\n# Set correct permissions for private keys\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n# Set correct permissions for public keys\nchmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n# Set correct permissions for SSH directory\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh\n```"}, {"name": "bitbucket", "trigger": "git", "content": "You have access to an environment variable, `BITBUCKET_TOKEN`, which allows you to interact with\nthe Bitbucket API.\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nYou can use `curl` with the `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` to interact with Bitbucket's API.\nALWAYS use the Bitbucket API for operations instead of a web browser.\nALWAYS use the `create_bitbucket_pr` tool to open a pull request\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nIf you encounter authentication issues when pushing to Bitbucket (such as password prompts or permission errors), the old token may have expired.
