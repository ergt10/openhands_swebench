The error message is: `table_name: (models.E028) db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName.`\n\n**1.2 Technical Details:**\n- Error code: `models.E028`\n- Error message: `db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models`\n- Affected Django versions: 2.2+ (worked in 2.0)\n- Context: Multiple apps pointing to different databases with same table names\n\n**1.3 Problem Explanation:**\nDjango is now enforcing that table names must be unique across all models in the project, even when those models are in different apps and potentially different databases.
