Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nUnroll the iterable for all/any calls to get better reports\nSometime I need to assert some predicate on all of an iterable, and for that the builtin functions `all`/`any` are great - but the failure messages aren't useful at all!\r\nFor example - the same test written in three ways:\r\n\r\n- A generator expression\r\n```sh                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \r\n    def test_all_even():\r\n        even_stevens = list(range(1,100,2))\r\n>       assert all(is_even(number) for number in even_stevens)\r\nE       assert False\r\nE        +  where False = all(<generator object test_all_even.<locals>.<genexpr> at 0x101f82ed0>)\r\n```\r\n- A list comprehension\r\n```sh\r\n    def test_all_even():\r\n        even_stevens = list(range(1,100,2))\r\n>       assert all([is_even(number) for number in even_stevens])\r\nE       assert False\r\nE        +  where False = all([False, False, False, False, False, False, ...])\r\n```\r\n- A for loop\r\n```sh\r\n    def test_all_even():\r\n        even_stevens = list(range(1,100,2))\r\n        for number in even_stevens:\r\n>           assert is_even(number)\r\nE           assert False\r\nE            +  where False = is_even(1)\r\n\r\ntest_all_any.py:7: AssertionError\r\n```\r\nThe only one that gives a meaningful report is the for loop - but it's way more wordy, and `all` asserts don't translate to a for loop nicely (I'll have to write a `break` or a helper function - yuck)\r\nI propose the assertion re-writer \"unrolls\" the iterator to the third form, and then uses the already existing reports.\r\n\r\n- [x] Include a detailed description of the bug or suggestion\r\n- [x] `pip list` of the virtual environment you are using\r\n```\r\nPackage        Version\r\n-------------- -------\r\natomicwrites   1.3.0  \r\nattrs          19.1.0 \r\nmore-itertools 7.0.0  \r\npip            19.0.3 \r\npluggy         0.9.0  \r\npy             1.8.0  \r\npytest         4.4.0  \r\nsetuptools     40.8.0 \r\nsix            1.12.0 \r\n```\r\n- [x] pytest and operating system versions\r\n`platform darwin -- Python 3.7.3, pytest-4.4.0, py-1.8.0, pluggy-0.9.0`\r\n- [x] Minimal example if possible\r\n\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__4.5 directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 10ca84ffc56c2dd2d9dc4bd71b7b898e083500cd.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.", "thought": ""}}
