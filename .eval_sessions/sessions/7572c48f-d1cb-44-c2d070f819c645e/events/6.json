They only show `False` without indicating which element(s) caused the failure.\\n\\n2. **Current behavior examples**:\\n   - Generator expression: `assert False` with `where False = all(<generator object ...>)`\\n   - List comprehension: `assert False` with `where False = all([False, False, False, ...])`\\n   - For loop: `assert False` with `where False = is_even(1)` - this is the desired behavior\\n\\n3. **Desired solution**: The assertion rewriter should \\\"unroll\\\" the iterator to something like the for loop form, providing meaningful error reports that show which specific element caused the assertion to fail.\\n\\n4. **Key technical details**:\\n   - This involves pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism\\n   - Need to transform `all(expr for item in iterable)` and `any(expr for item in iterable)` \\n   - Should work for both generator expressions and list comprehensions\\n   - The goal is to provide better error messages showing the failing element\\n\\n5. **Steps to reproduce**:\\n   - Create a test with `all(is_even(number) for number in even_stevens)` where some numbers are odd\\n   - Run pytest and observe the unhelpful error message\\n   - Compare with a for loop version that shows the specific failing element\\n\\n6. **Best practices for fixing**:\\n   - Minimal changes to existing code\\n   - Don't break existing functionality\\n   - Ensure the transformation preserves the original logic\\n   - Test edge cases like empty iterables, mixed types, etc.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 421, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 421, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
