READING: Understanding the Problem\n\nThe issue description states:\n1. **Need to manipulate the app_list in custom admin view** - The user wants access to the model class (not just serialized data) in the app_list context\n2. **Currently the dictionary is a serialized model** - The current `_build_app_dict` method only includes model metadata, not the actual model class\n3. **Make _build_app_dict method public** - Currently it's a private method (starts with underscore) but is used by both `index` and `app_index` views\n\nLet me look at the current model_dict structure to understand what's missing:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"thought\": \"\\nLooking at the _build_app_dict method (lines 433-499), I can see that the model_dict created on lines 463-469 contains:\\n- 'name': capfirst(model._meta.verbose_name_plural)\\n- 'object_name': model._meta.object_name  \\n- 'perms': perms\\n- 'admin_url': None\\n- 'add_url': None\\n\\nBut it doesn't include the actual model class itself. The user wants access to the model class so they can manipulate the app_list in custom admin views.\\n\\nThe requirements are:\\n1. Add the model class to the model_dict in the app_list context\\n2. Make _build_app_dict method public (remove the underscore prefix)\\n\\nThis is a straightforward change that involves:\\n1. Adding 'model': model to the model_dict\\n2. Renaming _build_app_dict to build_app_dict and updating all references\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_07", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 341, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 341, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
