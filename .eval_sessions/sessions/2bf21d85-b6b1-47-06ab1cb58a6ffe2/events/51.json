When multiple `AlterField` operations modify the same field incrementally, they should be collapsed into a single `AlterField` operation containing only the final field definition, but currently they are not.\\n\\n**5.2 Where the problem is located:**\\nThe problem is in the `AlterField.reduce()` method in `/workspace/django__django__5.0/django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` at lines 249-267. The method only handles reduction with `RemoveField` and `RenameField` operations, but doesn't handle the case where the operation to reduce with is also an `AlterField`.\\n\\n**5.3 How the test reproduces the issue:**\\nThe reproduction script creates multiple `AlterField` operations on the same field and runs the optimizer. When the operations include an `AddField` first, the optimization works because `AddField.reduce()` handles `AlterField` operations. But when only `AlterField` operations are present, the `AlterField.reduce()` method doesn't know how to reduce with another `AlterField`.\\n\\n**5.4 Best practices to take into account:**\\n- Follow the existing pattern used in other operations (like `AddField.reduce()`)\\n- Use the existing `is_same_field_operation()` method to check if operations target the same field\\n- Return the later operation when reducing, as it represents the final state\\n- Maintain backward compatibility\\n- Keep the change minimal and focused\\n\\n**5.5 How to fix the problem:**\\nAdd a condition in `AlterField.reduce()` to handle the case where `operation` is also an `AlterField` and both operations target the same field. When this happens, return `[operation]` (the later operation) since it represents the final state of the field.\\n\\nThe suggested fix from the issue description is exactly what's needed:\\n```python\\nif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(operation):\\n    return [operation]\\n```\\n\\nThis should be added at the beginning of the `reduce` method, before the existing conditions.\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_23", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 489, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 489, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
