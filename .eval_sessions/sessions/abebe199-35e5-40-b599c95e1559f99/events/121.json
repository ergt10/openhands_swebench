Let me summarize what I've learned:\\n\\n## Phase 1: READING - Problem Analysis\\n\\nThe issue is about squashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> Meta.indexes transition. The problem is that when migrations are squashed, deprecation warnings for index_together are not removed, even though the squashed migration should handle this transition cleanly.\\n\\nKey technical details:\\n1. `index_together` is deprecated in favor of `indexes` (RemovedInDjango51Warning)\\n2. The deprecation warning is generated in `django/db/models/options.py` lines 209-214\\n3. Migration squashing happens in `django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py`\\n4. Migration optimization happens in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`\\n5. There are operations like `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` that handle index changes\\n\\nThe problem is that when squashing migrations that contain `AlterIndexTogether` operations, the resulting squashed migration still contains the deprecated `index_together` operations, which will continue to generate deprecation warnings when the migration is applied.\\n\\n## Phase 2: RUNNING - I need to understand how to run tests\\n\\nLet me check the test setup and run some existing tests to understand the current behavior.\\n\\n## Phase 3: EXPLORATION - Key files identified:\\n\\n1. `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` - Contains `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations\\n2. `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` - Contains migration optimization logic\\n3. `django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py` - Contains squashing logic\\n4. `django/db/models/options.py` - Contains deprecation warning generation\\n5. `tests/migrations/test_optimizer.py` - Contains optimization tests\\n6. `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` - Contains squashmigrations tests\\n\\n## Phase 4: TEST CREATION - I need to create a reproduction script\\n\\nI should create a test that:\\n1. Creates migrations with `AlterIndexTogether` operations\\n2. Squashes them\\n3. Checks if the resulting squashed migration still has deprecation warnings\\n\\n## Phase 5: FIX ANALYSIS - The solution\\n\\nThe fix should be in the migration optimizer. When optimizing operations during squashing, the optimizer should:\\n1. Detect `AlterIndexTogether` operations\\n2. Convert them to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\\n3. Remove the `index_together` operations entirely\\n\\nThis would eliminate the deprecation warnings in the squashed migration.\\n\\nLet me proceed with creating a reproduction script first.\\n\"}", "name": "think"}, "id": "toolu_56", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 558, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 558, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "Your thought has been logged.", "extras": {}}
