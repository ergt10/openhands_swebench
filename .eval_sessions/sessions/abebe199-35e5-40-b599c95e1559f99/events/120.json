Let me summarize what I've learned:\n\n## Phase 1: READING - Problem Analysis\n\nThe issue is about squashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> Meta.indexes transition. The problem is that when migrations are squashed, deprecation warnings for index_together are not removed, even though the squashed migration should handle this transition cleanly.\n\nKey technical details:\n1. `index_together` is deprecated in favor of `indexes` (RemovedInDjango51Warning)\n2. The deprecation warning is generated in `django/db/models/options.py` lines 209-214\n3. Migration squashing happens in `django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py`\n4. Migration optimization happens in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`\n5. There are operations like `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` that handle index changes\n\nThe problem is that when squashing migrations that contain `AlterIndexTogether` operations, the resulting squashed migration still contains the deprecated `index_together` operations, which will continue to generate deprecation warnings when the migration is applied.\n\n## Phase 2: RUNNING - I need to understand how to run tests\n\nLet me check the test setup and run some existing tests to understand the current behavior.\n\n## Phase 3: EXPLORATION - Key files identified:\n\n1. `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` - Contains `AlterIndexTogether` and `AddIndex` operations\n2. `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` - Contains migration optimization logic\n3. `django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py` - Contains squashing logic\n4. `django/db/models/options.py` - Contains deprecation warning generation\n5. `tests/migrations/test_optimizer.py` - Contains optimization tests\n6. `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` - Contains squashmigrations tests\n\n## Phase 4: TEST CREATION - I need to create a reproduction script\n\nI should create a test that:\n1. Creates migrations with `AlterIndexTogether` operations\n2. Squashes them\n3. Checks if the resulting squashed migration still has deprecation warnings\n\n## Phase 5: FIX ANALYSIS - The solution\n\nThe fix should be in the migration optimizer. When optimizing operations during squashing, the optimizer should:\n1. Detect `AlterIndexTogether` operations\n2. Convert them to equivalent `AddIndex` operations\n3. Remove the `index_together` operations entirely\n\nThis would eliminate the deprecation warnings in the squashed migration.\n\nLet me proceed with creating a reproduction script first.\n", "action": "think", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "think", "tool_call_id": "toolu_56", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-fc76827686f8450997c13ff50f0a8a75", "created": 1767713772, "model": "/mnt/shared/models/GLM-4.6-FP8", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "<think></think>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"thought\": \"\\nNow I have a good understanding of the issue.
