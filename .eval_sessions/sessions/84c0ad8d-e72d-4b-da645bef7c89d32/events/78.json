I've successfully reproduced the issue. Let me analyze what I found:\n\n## Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: Understanding the Problem\n\n**5.1 Problem Statement:**\nThe Child model correctly inherits the `ordering = ['-pk']` from the Parent model, but when generating SQL, the Child query uses `ORDER BY \"__main___parent\".\"id\" ASC` instead of the expected `ORDER BY \"__main___parent\".\"id\" DESC`.\n\n**5.2 Problem Location:**\nThe issue is in the SQL compilation process, specifically in how the ordering is processed for inherited models. The problem appears to be in `/workspace/django__django__3.1/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` where the ordering is converted to SQL.\n\n**5.3 How the Test Reproduces the Issue:**\n- Parent model has `ordering = [\"-pk\"]` \n- Child model inherits from Parent without overriding ordering\n- Child._meta.ordering correctly shows `['-pk']`\n- But the generated SQL shows `ASC` instead of `DESC` for the parent table ordering\n\n**5.4 Best Practices:**\n- Model inheritance should preserve ordering semantics\n- SQL generation should respect the direction specified in Meta.ordering\n- The fix should be minimal and not break existing functionality\n\n**5.5 How to Fix:**\nThe issue is likely in the `get_order_by` method in `SQLCompiler` where the ordering from `_meta.ordering` is processed. The problem seems to be that when processing inherited models, the field resolution doesn't properly handle the `-` prefix for fields that reference parent tables.\n\nLet me examine the relevant code more closely:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"view\", \"path\": \"/workspace/django__django__3.1/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\", \"view_range\": [330, 370], \"security_risk\": \"LOW\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "toolu_37", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 407, "prompt_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 407, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": null, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.0, "max_budget_per_task": null, "accumulated_token_usage": {"model": "default", "prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 5087, "cache_read_tokens": 0, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "context_window": 0, "per_turn_token": 407, "response_id": ""}, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": []}, "args": {"path": "/workspace/django__django__3.1/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py", "start": 0, "end": -1, "thought": "<think></think>\nExcellent!
